    "## Non-Deterministic Generative Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most fundamental challenges when building products with Large Language Models (LLMs) is their generative and non-deterministic nature. Unlike traditional software systems where the same input reliably produces the same output, LLMs can generate novel text that may not exist in their training data, and produce different responses each time they're queried - even with identical prompts and input data. This behavior is both a strength and a significant engineering challenge and product challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you ask an LLM the same question multiple times, you'll likely get different responses. This isn't a bug - it's a fundamental feature of how these models work. The \"temperature\" parameter, which controls the randomness of outputs, allows models to be creative and generate diverse responses. However, this same feature makes it difficult to build reliable, testable systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a financial services company using LLMs to generate investment advice. The non-deterministic nature of these models means that:\n",
    "- The same input data could yield different analysis conclusions\n",
    "- Testing becomes exceedingly more complex compared to traditional software\n",
    "- Regulatory compliance becomes challenging to guarantee\n",
    "- User trust may be affected by inconsistent responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temperature and Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary source of non-determinism in LLMs comes from their sampling strategies. During text generation, the model:\n",
    "1. Calculates probability distributions for each next token\n",
    "2. Samples from these distributions based on temperature settings\n",
    "3. Uses techniques like nucleus sampling {cite}`holtzman2020curiouscaseneuraltext` or top-k sampling to balance creativity and coherence\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Temperature Spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "- Temperature = 0: Most deterministic, but potentially repetitive\n",
    "- Temperature = 1: Balanced creativity and coherence\n",
    "- Temperature > 1: Increased randomness, potentially incoherent\n",
    "\n",
    "A temperature of 1 represents the unscaled probability scores for each token in the vocabulary. Decreasing the temperature closer to 0 sharpens the distribution, so the most likely token will have an even higher probability score. Conversely, increasing the temperature makes the distribution more uniform {cite}`build-llms-from-scratch-book`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simple experiment, we use an LLM to write a single-statement executive summary of an input financial filing. We observe that even a simple parameter like temperature can dramatically alter model behavior in ways that are difficult to systematically assess. At temperature 0.0, responses are consistent but potentially too rigid. At 1.0, outputs become more varied but less predictable. At 2.0, responses can be wildly different and often incoherent. This non-deterministic behavior makes traditional software testing approaches inadequate."

The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product.\\nCloud Services\\nThe Company’s cloud services store and keep customers’ content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers.\\nDigital Content\\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store®, that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts.\\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade®, a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+SM, a personalized fitness service; Apple Music®, which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+®, a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+®, which offers exclusive original content and live sports.\\nPayment Services\\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card®, a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay®, a cashless payment service.\\nSegments\\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.\\nMarkets and Distribution\\nThe Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2024, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales.\\nCompetition\\nThe markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 2\\n\\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\\nSupply of Components\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\\nResearch and Development\\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\\nIntellectual Property\\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 3\\n\\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nHuman Capital\\nThe Company believes that its people play an important role in its success, and strives to attract, develop and retain the best talent. The Company works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members, so that its people can do the best work of their lives. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time equivalent employees.\\nCompensation and Benefits\\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world, including health, wellness and time away.\\nGrowth and Development\\nThe Company invests in resources to help its people develop and achieve their career goals. The Company offers programs through Apple University on leadership, management and influence, as well as Apple culture and values. Team members can also take advantage of online classes for business, technical and personal development, as well as learning opportunities to support their well-being.\\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.\\nInclusion and Diversity\\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.\\nEngagement\\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\\nHealth and Safety\\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 4\\n\\nAvailable Information\\nThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Such reports and other information filed by the Company with the SEC are available free of charge at investor.apple.com/investor-relations/sec-filings/default.aspx when such reports are available on the SEC’s website. The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-K is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\\nItem 1A.    Risk Factors\\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.\\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\\nThe Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. In addition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.\\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.\\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 5\\n\\nThe Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into them, and can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer and distribute affected products, services and third-party applications to its customers. Changing the Company’s business and supply chain in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions affecting the Company’s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business.\\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In addition, the Company’s and its suppliers’ operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company’s control. For example, global supply chains can be highly concentrated and geopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions.\\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings, increase the Company’s costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.\\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.\\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 6\\n\\nGlobal markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\\nThe Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.\\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.\\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\\nThe Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.\\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\\nBusiness Risks\\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.\\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software or other third-party support for the Company’s products and services, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. New products, services and technologies may replace or supersede existing offerings and may produce lower revenues and lower profit margins, which can materially adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 7\\n\\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\\nSubstantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, or conflict.\\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be disrupted or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\\nChanges or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties, including exposure to additional regulatory and operational risks.\\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. In addition, component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 8\\n\\nThe Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.\\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company’s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. The introduction of new and complex technologies, such as artificial intelligence features, can increase these and other safety risks, including exposing users to harmful, inaccurate or other negative content and experiences. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. Errors, bugs and vulnerabilities can be exploited by third parties, compromising the safety and security of a user’s device. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.\\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\\nThe Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can require the Company to modify certain products, services or features or preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 9\\n\\nThe Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products.\\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\\nThe Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices can suffer.\\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company’s products.\\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. Where applicable, the Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its products and services, including taking actions in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements, and expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari® in the European Union (“EU”) as it seeks to comply with the Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces (“APIs”) for developers. Changes to the Company’s products and services could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including if such business changes result in reduced App Store or other sales, reductions in the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales, or if the rate of the commission is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated.\\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers.\\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 10\\n\\nThe Company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.\\nMuch of the Company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s culture, reputation and operational flexibility.\\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.\\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts.\\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\\nThe Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.\\nThe Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\\nThe Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information with respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to systems and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 11\\n\\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which can result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of geopolitical tensions or conflict.\\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.\\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and are vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company’s or its suppliers’ and other third parties’ employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or such suppliers’ or third parties’ systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.\\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company’s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\\nThe Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 12\\n\\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.\\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek broad injunctive relief and substantial damages.\\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services.\\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to develop, manufacture, use, import or offer for sale certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company’s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s business or supply chain. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services, or as the Company expands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence features, and must navigate new legal, regulatory and ethical considerations relating to such technologies. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 13\\n\\nRegulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of the Company’s announced goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company’s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state and international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.\\nThe Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari in the EU as it seeks to comply with the DMA, including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s operating systems, and additional tools and APIs for developers. The Company has also continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the European Commission (the “Commission”). Although the Company’s compliance plan is intended to address the DMA’s obligations, it has been challenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private litigants. The DMA provides for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance, and other jurisdictions may seek to require the Company to make changes to its business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new privacy and security risks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain.\\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is subject to civil antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” generally in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are resolved against the Company, the Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its business practices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with Google LLC and other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 14\\n\\nThere can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\\nThe Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.\\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.\\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nFinancial Risks\\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\\nThe Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, supply or manufacturing partners.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 15\\n\\nThe Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\\nThe Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.\\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not realized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 28, 2024, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.\\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 16\\n\\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\\nGeneral Risks\\nThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.\\nThe Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\\nItem 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments\\nNone.\\nItem 1C.    Cybersecurity\\nThe Company’s management, led by its Head of Corporate Information Security, has overall responsibility for identifying, assessing and managing any material risks from cybersecurity threats. The Company’s Head of Corporate Information Security leads a dedicated Information Security team of highly skilled individuals with experience across industries that, among other things, develops and distributes information security policies, standards and procedures; engages in employee cybersecurity training; implements security controls; assesses security risk and compliance posture; monitors and responds to security events; and executes security testing and assessments. The Company’s Head of Corporate Information Security has extensive knowledge and skills gained from over 25 years of experience in the cybersecurity industry, including serving in leadership positions at other large technology companies and leading the Company’s Information Security team since 2016.\\nThe Company’s Information Security team coordinates with teams across the Company to prevent, respond to and manage security incidents, and engages third parties, as appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of its security processes and incident response. A dedicated Supplier Trust team manages information security risks the Company is exposed to through its supplier relationships. The Company has processes to log, track, address, and escalate for further assessment and report, as appropriate, cybersecurity incidents across the Company and its suppliers to senior management and the Audit and Finance Committee (the “Audit Committee”) of the Board. The Company’s enterprise risk management program is designed to identify, assess, and monitor the Company’s business risks, including financial, operational, compliance and reputational risks, and reflects management’s assessment of cybersecurity risks.\\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board in the oversight and monitoring of cybersecurity matters. The Audit Committee regularly reviews and discusses the Company’s cybersecurity risks with management, including the Company’s Head of Corporate Information Security, its General Counsel and the Heads of Compliance and Business Conduct, Business Assurance, and Internal Audit, and receives updates, as necessary, regarding cybersecurity incidents. The Chair of the Audit Committee regularly reports the substance of such reviews and discussions to the Board, as necessary, and recommends to the Board such actions as the Audit Committee deems appropriate.\\nFor a discussion of the Company’s cybersecurity-related risks, see Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.”\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 17\\n\\nItem 2.    Properties\\nThe Company’s headquarters is located in Cupertino, California. As of September 28, 2024, the Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporate functions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in various places outside the U.S. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.\\nItem 3.    Legal Proceedings\\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the Company under the DMA. The Commission’s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company’s App Store rules are in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA. If the Commission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission’s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.\\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\\nEpic Games\\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Company’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the Company has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the injunction. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\\nOther Legal Proceedings\\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\\nItem 4.

During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company also utilized the final $4.1 billion under its previous repurchase program, which was authorized in May 2023. The programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares.

net sales.\\nServices gross margin percentage increased during 2024 compared to 2023 due to a different Services mix.\\nThe Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure.\\nOperating Expenses\\nOperating expenses for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (dollars in millions):\\n2024\\t\\tChange\\t\\t2023\\t\\tChange\\t\\t2022\\nResearch and

Development\\nThe growth in R&D expense during 2024 compared to 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses.\\nSelling, General and Administrative\\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased $1.2 billion during 2024 compared to 2023.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 24\\n\\nProvision for Income Taxes\\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (dollars in millions):\\n2024\\t\\t2023\\t\\t2022\\nProvision for income taxes\\t$\\t29,749 \\t\\t\\t$\\t16,741 \\t\\t\\t$\\t19,300 \\t\\nEffective tax rate\\t24.1 \\t%\\t\\t14.7 \\t%\\t\\t16.2 \\t%\\nStatutory federal income tax rate\\t21 \\t%\\t\\t21 \\t%\\t\\t21 \\t%\\n \\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for 2024 was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, net, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 7, “Income Taxes” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) and state income taxes, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation.\\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for 2024 was higher compared to 2023 due primarily to a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, net, related to the State Aid Decision, a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings and lower tax benefits from share-based compensation.\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nThe Company believes its balances of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which totaled $140.8 billion as of September 28, 2024, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.\\nThe Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations:\\nDebt\\nAs of September 28, 2024, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $97.3 billion (collectively the “Notes”), with $10.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $38.5 billion, with $2.6 billion payable within 12 months.\\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had $10.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months.\\nLeases\\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.6 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months.\\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.0 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months.\\nOther Purchase Obligations\\nThe Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights.

The funds necessary to settle the obligation were held in escrow as of September 28, 2024, and restricted from general use.\\nCapital Return Program\\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 28, 2024, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.25 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board.\\nIn May 2024, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $110 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.24 to $0.25 per share beginning in May 2024. During 2024, the Company repurchased $95.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.2 billion.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIncome Taxes\\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”), which will require the Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the Company to disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-09 in its fourth quarter of 2026 using a prospective transition method.\\nSegment Reporting\\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which will require the Company to disclose segment expenses that are significant and regularly provided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). In addition, ASU 2023-07 will require the Company to disclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses segment profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-07 in its fourth quarter of 2025 using a retrospective transition method.\\nCritical Accounting Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\\nUncertain Tax Positions\\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the TCJA and the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\\nLegal and Other Contingencies\\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 26\\n\\nItem 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (dollars in millions):\\nInterest Rate\\nSensitive Instrument\\nHypothetical Interest\\nRate Increase\\nPotential Impact\\n2024\\t\\t2023\\nInvestment portfolio\\n100 basis points, all tenors\\nDecline in fair value\\n$\\t2,755 \\t\\t\\t$\\t3,089 \\t\\nTerm debt\\n100 basis points, all tenors\\nIncrease in annual interest expense\\n$\\t139 \\t\\t\\t$\\t194 \\t\\n \\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $538 million and $669 million as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Changes in the Company’s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company’s foreign currency derivatives.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 27\\n\\nItem 8.

Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 33\\n\\nApple Inc.\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the use of management estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.\\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2024 and 2022 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\\nRevenue\\nThe Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities.\\nShare-Based Compensation\\nThe Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest.\\nCash Equivalents\\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are treated as cash equivalents.\\nMarketable Securities\\nThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.\\nInventories\\nInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis.\\nDerivative Instruments\\nThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\nIncome Taxes\\nThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the TCJA.\\nLeases\\nThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, data center and retail facilities.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 34\\n\\nNote 2 – Revenue\\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac and iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):\\n2024\\t\\t2023\\t\\t2022\\niPhone\\n$\\t201,183 \\t\\t\\t$\\t200,583 \\t\\t\\t$\\t205,489 \\t\\nMac\\n29,984 \\t\\t\\t29,357 \\t\\t\\t40,177 \\t\\niPad\\n26,694 \\t\\t\\t28,300 \\t\\t\\t29,292 \\t\\nWearables, Home and Accessories\\n37,005 \\t\\t\\t39,845 \\t\\t\\t41,241 \\t\\nServices (1)\\n96,169 \\t\\t\\t85,200 \\t\\t\\t78,129 \\t\\nTotal net sales\\t$\\t391,035 \\t\\t\\t$\\t383,285 \\t\\t\\t$\\t394,328 \\t\\n \\n(1)Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.\\nTotal net sales include $7.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2023, $8.2 billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, and $7.5 billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 35\\n\\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 13, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2024, 2023 and 2022, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\\nAs of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.8 billion and $12.1 billion, respectively. As of September 28, 2024, the Company expects 64% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 25% within one-to-two years, 9% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than three years.\\nNote 3 – Earnings Per Share\\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2024, 2023 and 2022 (net income in millions and shares in

The Company classifies marketable debt securities as either current or non-current based on each instrument’s underlying maturity.\\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\\nThe Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating activities.\\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 37\\n\\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 28, 2024, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 18 years.\\nThe Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.\\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows (in millions):\\n2024\\t\\t2023\\nDerivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:\\t\\t\\t\\nForeign exchange contracts\\t$\\t64,069 \\t\\t\\t$\\t74,730 \\t\\nInterest rate contracts\\t$\\t14,575 \\t\\t\\t$\\t19,375 \\t\\nDerivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges:\\t\\t\\t\\nForeign exchange contracts\\t$\\t91,493 \\t\\t\\t$\\t104,777 \\t\\n \\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows (in millions):\\n2024\\t\\t2023\\nHedged assets/(liabilities):\\t\\t\\t\\nCurrent and non-current marketable securities\\t$\\t— \\t\\t\\t$\\t14,433 \\t\\nCurrent and non-current term debt\\t$\\t(13,505)\\t\\t\\t$\\t(18,247)\\t\\n \\nAccounts Receivable\\nTrade Receivables\\nThe Company’s third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 38% and 41% of total trade receivables as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk.\\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are sold by the Company. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 44% and 23%. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 48% and 23%.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 38\\n\\nNote 5 – Property, Plant and Equipment\\nThe following table shows the Company’s gross property, plant and equipment by major asset class and accumulated depreciation as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (in millions):\\n2024\\t\\t2023\\nLand and buildings\\t$\\t24,690 \\t\\t\\t$\\t23,446 \\t\\nMachinery, equipment and internal-use software\\t80,205 \\t\\t\\t78,314 \\t\\nLeasehold improvements\\t14,233 \\t\\t\\t12,839 \\t\\nGross property, plant and equipment\\t119,128 \\t\\t\\t114,599 \\t\\nAccumulated depreciation\\n(73,448)\\t\\t\\t(70,884)\\t\\nTotal property, plant and equipment, net\\t$\\t45,680 \\t\\t\\t$\\t43,715 \\t\\n \\nDepreciation expense on property, plant and equipment was $8.2 billion, $8.5 billion and $8.7 billion during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\nNote 6 – Consolidated Financial Statement Details\\nThe following tables show the Company’s consolidated financial statement details as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (in millions):\\nOther Non-Current Assets\\n2024\\t\\t2023\\nDeferred tax assets\\t$\\t19,499 \\t\\t\\t$\\t17,852 \\t\\nOther non-current assets\\t55,335 \\t\\t\\t46,906 \\t\\nTotal other non-current assets\\t$\\t74,834 \\t\\t\\t$\\t64,758 \\t\\n \\nOther Current Liabilities\\n2024\\t\\t2023\\nIncome taxes payable\\t$\\t26,601 \\t\\t\\t$\\t8,819 \\t\\nOther current liabilities\\t51,703 \\t\\t\\t50,010 \\t\\nTotal other current liabilities\\t$\\t78,304 \\t\\t\\t$\\t58,829 \\t\\n \\nOther Non-Current Liabilities\\n2024\\t\\t2023\\nIncome taxes payable\\n$\\t9,254 \\t\\t\\t$\\t15,457 \\t\\nOther non-current liabilities\\t36,634 \\t\\t\\t34,391 \\t\\nTotal other non-current liabilities\\t$\\t45,888 \\t\\t\\t$\\t49,848 \\t\\n \\nNote 7 – Income Taxes\\nEuropean Commission State Aid Decision\\nOn August 30, 2016, the Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2 billion.\\nFrom time to time, the Company requested approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 28, 2024, the adjusted recovery amount of €12.7 billion plus interest of €1.2 billion was held in escrow and restricted from general use. The total balance of the escrow, including net unrealized investment gains, was €14.2 billion or $15.8 billion as of September 28, 2024, of which $2.6 billion was classified as cash and cash equivalents and $13.2 billion was classified as current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note 4, “Financial Instruments” for more information.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 39\\n\\nThe Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023. On September 10, 2024, the ECJ announced that it had set aside the 2020 judgment of the General Court and confirmed the Commission’s 2016 State Aid Decision. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2024 the Company recorded a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, net, which represents $15.8 billion payable to Ireland via release of the escrow, partially offset by a U.S. foreign tax credit of $4.8 billion and a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of $823 million.\\nProvision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate\\nThe provision for income taxes for 2024, 2023 and 2022, consisted of the following (in millions):\\n2024\\t\\t2023\\t\\t2022\\nFederal:\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nCurrent\\t$\\t5,571 \\t\\t\\t$\\t9,445 \\t\\t\\t$\\t7,890 \\t\\nDeferred\\t(3,080)\\t\\t\\t(3,644)\\t\\t\\t(2,265)\\t\\nTotal\\t2,491 \\t\\t\\t5,801 \\t\\t\\t5,625 \\t\\nState:\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nCurrent\\t1,726 \\t\\t\\t1,570 \\t\\t\\t1,519 \\t\\nDeferred\\t(298)\\t\\t\\t(49)\\t\\t\\t84 \\t\\nTotal\\t1,428 \\t\\t\\t1,521 \\t\\t\\t1,603 \\t\\nForeign:\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nCurrent\\t25,483 \\t\\t\\t8,750 \\t\\t\\t8,996 \\t\\nDeferred\\t347 \\t\\t\\t669 \\t\\t\\t3,076 \\t\\nTotal\\t25,830 \\t\\t\\t9,419 \\t\\t\\t12,072 \\t\\nProvision for income taxes\\t$\\t29,749 \\t\\t\\t$\\t16,741 \\t\\t\\t$\\t19,300 \\t\\n \\nForeign pretax earnings were $77.3 billion, $72.9 billion and $71.3 billion in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\nA reconciliation of the provision for income taxes to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (21% in 2024, 2023 and 2022) to income before provision for income taxes for 2024, 2023 and 2022, is as follows (dollars in millions):\\n2024\\t\\t2023\\t\\t2022\\nComputed expected tax\\t$\\t25,932 \\t\\t\\t$\\t23,885 \\t\\t\\t$\\t25,012 \\t\\nState taxes, net of federal effect\\t1,162 \\t\\t\\t1,124 \\t\\t\\t1,518 \\t\\nImpact of the State Aid Decision\\n10,246 \\t\\t\\t— \\t\\t\\t— \\t\\nEarnings of foreign subsidiaries\\t(5,311)\\t\\t\\t(5,744)\\t\\t\\t(4,366)\\t\\nResearch and development credit, net\\t(1,397)\\t\\t\\t(1,212)\\t\\t\\t(1,153)\\t\\nExcess tax benefits from equity awards\\t(893)\\t\\t\\t(1,120)\\t\\t\\t(1,871)\\t\\nOther\\t10 \\t\\t\\t(192)\\t\\t\\t160 \\t\\nProvision for income taxes\\t$\\t29,749 \\t\\t\\t$\\t16,741 \\t\\t\\t$\\t19,300 \\t\\nEffective tax rate\\t24.1 \\t%\\t\\t14.7 \\t%\\t\\t16.2 \\t%\\n \\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 40\\n\\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\\nAs of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):\\n2024\\t\\t2023\\nDeferred tax assets:\\t\\t\\t\\nCapitalized research and development\\t$\\t10,739 \\t\\t\\t$\\t6,294 \\t\\nTax credit carryforwards\\t8,856 \\t\\t\\t8,302 \\t\\nAccrued liabilities and other reserves\\t6,114 \\t\\t\\t6,365 \\t\\nDeferred revenue\\t3,413 \\t\\t\\t4,571 \\t\\nLease liabilities\\t2,410 \\t\\t\\t2,421 \\t\\nUnrealized losses\\t1,173 \\t\\t\\t2,447 \\t\\nOther\\t2,168 \\t\\t\\t2,343 \\t\\nTotal deferred tax assets\\t34,873 \\t\\t\\t32,743 \\t\\nLess: Valuation allowance\\t(8,866)\\t\\t\\t(8,374)\\t\\nTotal deferred tax assets, net\\t26,007 \\t\\t\\t24,369 \\t\\nDeferred tax liabilities:\\t\\t\\t\\nDepreciation\\t2,551 \\t\\t\\t1,998 \\t\\nRight-of-use assets\\t2,125 \\t\\t\\t2,179 \\t\\nMinimum tax on foreign earnings\\t1,674 \\t\\t\\t1,940 \\t\\nUnrealized gains\\t— \\t\\t\\t511 \\t\\nOther\\t455 \\t\\t\\t490 \\t\\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\\t6,805 \\t\\t\\t7,118 \\t\\nNet deferred tax assets\\t$\\t19,202 \\t\\t\\t$\\t17,251 \\t\\n \\nAs of September 28, 2024, the Company had $5.1 billion in foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland and $3.6 billion in California R&D credit carryforwards, both of which can be carried forward indefinitely. A valuation allowance has been recorded for the credit carryforwards and a portion of other temporary differences.\\nUncertain Tax Positions\\nAs of September 28, 2024, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $22.0 billion, of which $10.8 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 30, 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $19.5 billion, of which $9.5 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate.\\nThe aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2024, 2023 and 2022, is as follows (in millions):\\n2024\\t\\t2023\\t\\t2022\\nBeginning balances\\t$\\t19,454 \\t\\t\\t$\\t16,758 \\t\\t\\t$\\t15,477 \\t\\nIncreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year\\t1,727 \\t\\t\\t2,044 \\t\\t\\t2,284 \\t\\nDecreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year\\t(386)\\t\\t\\t(1,463)\\t\\t\\t(1,982)\\t\\nIncreases related to tax positions taken during the current year\\t2,542 \\t\\t\\t2,628 \\t\\t\\t1,936 \\t\\nDecreases related to settlements with taxing authorities\\t(1,070)\\t\\t\\t(19)\\t\\t\\t(28)\\t\\nDecreases related to expiration of the statute of limitations\\t(229)\\t\\t\\t(494)\\t\\t\\t(929)\\t\\nEnding balances\\t$\\t22,038 \\t\\t\\t$\\t19,454 \\t\\t\\t$\\t16,758 \\t\\n \\nThe Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions.

The 2014 Plan permitted the granting of the same types of equity awards with substantially the same terms as the 2022 Plan. The 2014 Plan also permitted the granting of cash bonus awards. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company terminated the authority to grant new awards under the 2014 Plan.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 44\\n\\nRestricted Stock Units\\nA summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for 2024, 2023 and 2022, is as follows:\\nNumber of\\nRSUs\\n(in thousands)\\nWeighted-Average\\nGrant-Date Fair\\nValue Per RSU\\nAggregate\\nFair Value\\n(in millions)\\nBalance as of September 25, 2021\\t240,427 \\t\\t\\t$\\t75.16 \\t\\t\\t\\nRSUs granted\\t91,674 \\t\\t\\t$\\t150.70 \\t\\t\\t\\nRSUs vested\\t(115,861)\\t\\t\\t$\\t72.12 \\t\\t\\t\\nRSUs canceled\\t(14,739)\\t\\t\\t$\\t99.77 \\t\\t\\t\\nBalance as of September 24, 2022\\t201,501 \\t\\t\\t$\\t109.48 \\t\\t\\t\\nRSUs granted\\t88,768 \\t\\t\\t$\\t150.87 \\t\\t\\t\\nRSUs vested\\t(101,878)\\t\\t\\t$\\t97.31 \\t\\t\\t\\nRSUs canceled\\t(8,144)\\t\\t\\t$\\t127.98 \\t\\t\\t\\nBalance as of September 30, 2023\\t180,247 \\t\\t\\t$\\t135.91 \\t\\t\\t\\nRSUs granted\\t80,456 \\t\\t\\t$\\t173.78 \\t\\t\\t\\nRSUs vested\\t(87,633)\\t\\t\\t$\\t127.59 \\t\\t\\t\\nRSUs canceled\\t(9,744)\\t\\t\\t$\\t140.80 \\t\\t\\t\\nBalance as of September 28, 2024\\t163,326 \\t\\t\\t$\\t158.73 \\t\\t\\t$\\t37,204 \\t\\n \\nThe fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $15.8 billion, $15.9 billion and $18.2 billion for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 31 million, 37 million and 41 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments to taxing authorities for employees’ tax obligations were $5.6 billion in both 2024 and 2023 and $6.4 billion in 2022.\\nShare-Based Compensation\\nThe following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in millions):\\n2024\\t\\t2023\\t\\t2022\\nShare-based compensation expense\\t$\\t11,688 \\t\\t\\t$\\t10,833 \\t\\t\\t$\\t9,038 \\t\\nIncome tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense\\t$\\t(3,350)\\t\\t\\t$\\t(3,421)\\t\\t\\t$\\t(4,002)\\t\\n \\nAs of September 28, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs was $19.4 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years.\\nNote 12 – Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations\\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\\nThe Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. Future payments under unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 28, 2024, are as follows (in millions):\\n2025\\t$\\t3,206 \\t\\n2026\\t2,440 \\t\\n2027\\t1,156 \\t\\n2028\\t3,121 \\t\\n2029\\t633 \\t\\nThereafter\\t670 \\t\\nTotal\\t$\\t11,226 \\t\\n \\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 45\\n\\nContingencies\\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\\nNote 13 – Segment Information and Geographic Data\\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.\\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. The information provided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions and assessing segment performance excludes asset information.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 46\\n\\nThe following table shows information by reportable segment for 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in millions):\\n2024\\t\\t2023\\t\\t2022\\nAmericas:\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nNet sales\\t$\\t167,045 \\t\\t\\t$\\t162,560 \\t\\t\\t$\\t169,658 \\t\\nOperating income\\t$\\t67,656 \\t\\t\\t$\\t60,508 \\t\\t\\t$\\t62,683 \\t\\nEurope:\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nNet sales\\t$\\t101,328 \\t\\t\\t$\\t94,294 \\t\\t\\t$\\t95,118 \\t\\nOperating income\\t$\\t41,790 \\t\\t\\t$\\t36,098 \\t\\t\\t$\\t35,233 \\t\\nGreater China:\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nNet sales\\t$\\t66,952 \\t\\t\\t$\\t72,559 \\t\\t\\t$\\t74,200 \\t\\nOperating income\\t$\\t27,082 \\t\\t\\t$\\t30,328 \\t\\t\\t$\\t31,153 \\t\\nJapan:\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nNet sales\\t$\\t25,052 \\t\\t\\t$\\t24,257 \\t\\t\\t$\\t25,977 \\t\\nOperating income\\t$\\t12,454 \\t\\t\\t$\\t11,888 \\t\\t\\t$\\t12,257 \\t\\nRest of Asia Pacific:\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nNet sales\\t$\\t30,658 \\t\\t\\t$\\t29,615 \\t\\t\\t$\\t29,375 \\t\\nOperating income\\t$\\t13,062 \\t\\t\\t$\\t12,066 \\t\\t\\t$\\t11,569 \\t\\n \\nA reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2024, 2023 and 2022 is as follows (in millions):\\n2024\\t\\t2023\\t\\t2022\\nSegment operating income\\t$\\t162,044 \\t\\t\\t$\\t150,888 \\t\\t\\t$\\t152,895 \\t\\nResearch and development expense\\t(31,370)\\t\\t\\t(29,915)\\t\\t\\t(26,251)\\t\\nOther corporate expenses, net (1)\\n(7,458)\\t\\t\\t(6,672)\\t\\t\\t(7,207)\\t\\nTotal operating income\\t$\\t123,216 \\t\\t\\t$\\t114,301 \\t\\t\\t$\\t119,437 \\t\\n \\n(1)Includes general and administrative compensation costs, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed costs.\\nThe following tables show net sales for 2024, 2023 and 2022 and long-lived assets as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 for countries that individually accounted for 10% or more of the respective totals, as well as aggregate amounts for the remaining countries (in millions):\\n2024\\t\\t2023\\t\\t2022\\nNet sales:\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nU.S.\\t$\\t142,196 \\t\\t\\t$\\t138,573 \\t\\t\\t$\\t147,859 \\t\\nChina (1)\\n66,952 \\t\\t\\t72,559 \\t\\t\\t74,200 \\t\\nOther countries\\t181,887 \\t\\t\\t172,153 \\t\\t\\t172,269 \\t\\nTotal net sales\\t$\\t391,035 \\t\\t\\t$\\t383,285 \\t\\t\\t$\\t394,328 \\t\\n \\n2024\\t\\t2023\\nLong-lived assets:\\t\\t\\t\\nU.S.\\t$\\t35,664 \\t\\t\\t$\\t33,276 \\t\\nChina (1)\\n4,797 \\t\\t\\t5,778 \\t\\nOther countries\\t5,219 \\t\\t\\t4,661 \\t\\nTotal long-lived assets\\t$\\t45,680 \\t\\t\\t$\\t43,715 \\t\\n \\n(1)China includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 47\\n\\n\\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.\\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. (the “Company”) as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 1, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matter\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\\nUncertain Tax Positions\\nDescription of the Matter\\t\\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. As of September 28, 2024, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $22.0 billion, of which $10.8 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. In accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, the Company uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws.\\nAuditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\\n \\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 48\\n\\nHow We Addressed the\\nMatter in Our Audit\\t\\nWe tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions that qualify for recognition, and the related disclosures.\\nWe evaluated the Company’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained and the related measurement of the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. Our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, the Company’s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. For a certain tax position, we also received an external legal counsel confirmation letter and discussed the matter with external advisors and the Company’s tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated the Company’s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 7 to the financial statements.\\n \\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2009.\\n\\nSan Jose, California\\nNovember 1, 2024\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 49\\n\\n\\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.\\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nWe have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, Apple Inc. (the “Company”) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated November 1, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n\\n\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\n\\nSan Jose, California\\nNovember 1, 2024\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 50\\n\\nItem 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\\nNone.\\nItem 9A.    Controls and Procedures\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 28, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: \\n(i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;\\n(ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and\\n(iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 28, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2024, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 51\\n\\nItem 9B.

    "How can one effectively test an LLM-powered system when the same prompt can yield radically different outputs based on a single parameter? Traditional testing relies on predictable inputs and outputs, but LLMs force us to grapple with probabilistic behavior. While lower temperatures may seem safer for critical applications, they don't necessarily eliminate the underlying uncertainty. This highlights the need for new evaluation paradigms that can handle both deterministic and probabilistic aspects of LLM behavior."

    "## Emerging Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond their non-deterministic nature, LLMs present another fascinating characteristic: emergent abilities that spontaneously arise as models scale up in size. These abilities - from basic question answering to complex reasoning - aren't explicitly programmed but rather emerge \"naturally\" as the models grow larger and are trained on more data. This makes evaluation fundamentally different from traditional software testing, where capabilities are explicitly coded and can be tested against pre-defined specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "{numref}`emerging-properties` provides a list of emergent abilities of large language models and the scale. The relationship between model scale and emergent abilities follows a fascinating non-linear pattern. Below certain size thresholds, specific abilities may be completely absent from the model - it simply cannot perform certain tasks, no matter how much you try to coax them out. However, once the model reaches critical points in its scaling journey, these abilities can suddenly manifest in what researchers call a phase transition - a dramatic shift from inability to capability. This unpredictable emergence of capabilities stands in stark contrast to traditional software development, where features are deliberately implemented and can be systematically tested.\n",

    "\n",
    "The implications for evaluation are critical. While conventional software testing relies on stable test suites and well-defined acceptance criteria, LLM evaluation must contend with a constantly shifting landscape of capabilities. What worked to evaluate a 7B parameter model may be completely inadequate for a 70B parameter model that has developed new emergent abilities. This dynamic nature of LLM capabilities forces us to fundamentally rethink our approach to testing and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a practical example that illustrates these challenges: building a Math AI tutoring system for children powered by an LLM. In traditional software development, you would define specific features (like presenting math problems or checking answers) and write tests to verify each function. But with LLMs, you're not just testing predefined features - you're trying to evaluate emergent capabilities like adapting explanations to a child's level, maintaining engagement through conversational learning, and providing age-appropriate safety-bound content.\n",
    "\n",
    "This fundamental difference raises critical questions about evaluation:\n",
    "- How do we measure capabilities that weren't explicitly programmed?\n",
    "- How can we ensure consistent performance when abilities may suddenly emerge or evolve?\n",
    "- What metrics can capture both the technical accuracy and the subjective quality of responses?\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge becomes even more complex when we consider that traditional software evaluation methods simply weren't designed for these kinds of systems - There is an **Evals Gap** between traditional software testing and LLM evaluation. We need new frameworks that can account for both the deterministic aspects we're used to testing and the emergent properties that make LLMs unique. \n",
    "\n",
    "{numref}`evals-table` explores how LLM evaluation differs from traditional software testing across several key dimensions:\n",
    "- **Capability Assessment vs Functional Testing**: Traditional software testing validates specific functionality against predefined requirements. LLM evaluation must assess not necessarily pre-defined behavior but also \"emergent properties\" like reasoning, creativity, and language understanding that extend beyond explicit programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Metrics and Measurement Challenges**: While traditional software metrics can usually be precisely defined and measured, LLM evaluation often involves subjective qualities like \"helpfulness\" or \"naturalness\" that resist straightforward quantification. Even when we try to break these down into numeric scores, the underlying judgment often remains inherently human and context-dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset Contamination**: Traditional software testing uses carefully crafted test cases with known inputs and expected outputs (e.g., unit tests). In contrast, LLMs trained on massive internet-scale datasets risk having already seen and memorized evaluation examples during training, which can lead to artificially inflated performance scores. This requires careful dataset curation to ensure test sets are truly unseen by the model and rigorous cross-validation approaches.\n",
    "\n",

    "First, it's important to make a distinction between evaluating an LLM versus evaluating an LLM-based application. While the latter offers foundation capabilities and are typically general-purpose, the former is more specific and tailored to a particular use case. Here, we define an LLM-based application as a system that uses one or more LLMs to perform a specific task. More specifically, an LLM-based application is the combination of one or more LLM models, their associated prompts and parameters to solve a particular business problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "That differentiation is important because it changes the scope of evaluation. LLMs are usually evaluated based on their capabilities, which include things like language understanding, reasoning and knowledge. LLM-based applications, instead, should be evaluated based on their end-to-end functionality, performance, and how well they meet business requirements. That distinction has key implications for the design of evaluation systems:\n",

    "- How can business updates and user data be reflected in the dataset post-launch?\n",

    "  * Which LLM application variations should be tested to maximize what we learn?\n",
    "  * Which LLM capabilities provide the most value for the business and how can we measure that?\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Evaluator Design:**\n",
    "- How do we define success for different types of tasks?\n",
    "  * Task-specific evaluation criteria\n",
    "  * Objective metrics vs subjective assessment\n",
    "- Should evaluation be automated or involve human review?\n",
    "  * Balance between automation and human judgment\n",
    "  * Inter-rater reliability for human evaluation\n",
    "  * Cost and scalability considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Scoring System:**\n",

Finally, one should keep in mind that the evaluation system itself requires validation to confirm its accuracy and reliability vis-a-vis business requirements (evaluating evaluators will be later discussed in this Chapter)."

    "## Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of metric depends on the specific task and desired evaluation criteria. However, one can categorize metrics into two broad categories: **intrinsic** and **extrinsic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Intrinsic metrics** focus on the model's performance on its primary training objective, which is typically to predict the next token in a sequence.  Perplexity is a common intrinsic metric that measures how well the model predicts a given sample of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Extrinsic metrics** assess the model's performance on various downstream tasks, which can range from question answering to code generation.  These metrics are not directly tied to the training objective, but they provide valuable insights into the model's ability to generalize to real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are particularly interested in extrinsic metrics, since we are evaluating LLM-based applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think about metrics is in terms of the type of the task we evaluate:\n",
    "1. **Discriminative Task**:\n",
    "   - Involves distinguishing or classifying between existing data points.\n",
    "   - Examples: Sentiment analysis, classification, or identifying whether a statement is true or false.\n",
    "2. **Generative Task**:\n",
    "   - Involves creating or producing new data or outputs.\n",
    "   - Examples: Text generation, image synthesis, or summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For discriminative tasks, LLM-based applications may produce log-probabilities or discrete predictions, traditional machine learning metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score can be applied. However, generative tasks may output text or images which require different evaluation approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "For generative tasks, a range of specialized metrics should be considered. These include match-based metrics such as exact match and prefix match, as well as metrics designed specifically for tasks like summarization and translation, including ROUGE, BLEU, and character n-gram comparisons. The selection of appropriate metrics should align with the specific requirements and characteristics of the task being evaluated.\n",

    "| **BERTScore** | Uses contextual embeddings from pre-trained BERT to calculate token similarity | Tasks requiring semantic equivalence | - High computational cost<br>- Performance varies with model used |\n",

While it omits product lines, it effectively captures the essential elements of the filing including business operations, risks, and financial condition. Its brevity and focus look (subjectively) similar to our benchmark model.\n",

While it includes relevant information about SEC compliance, it introduces peripheral details about seasoned issuer status and forward-looking statements. The additional complexity makes the summary less focused than gpt-4o-mini's version.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `gpt-3.5-turbo` looks quite different from the benchmark. Its summary, while factually correct, is overly simplified and misses key aspects of the filing. The model captures basic financial information but fails to convey the breadth of operational and compliance details present in the benchmark summary.\n",

The evaluation metrics puts `gpt-4o-mini` as the closest aligned to the benchmark, followed by gpt-4-turbo, and gpt-3.5-turbo showing the largest deviation. This suggests that `gpt-4o-mini` is the best model for this task at least on the metrics we have chosen and for the set of models we have tested.\n",

    "*   **Sensitivity to data distribution**: Performance on these metrics can be influenced by the specific dataset used for evaluation, which might not represent real-world data distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "Traditional metrics like BLEU or ROUGE often fall short in capturing the nuanced, contextual, and creative outputs of LLMs. As an alternative we can consider a \"Model-based evaluation\" approach. A common approach is to use an LLM as a judge. This is an approach that leverages language models themselves to assess the quality of outputs from other language models. This method involves using a model (often a more capable one) to act as an automated judge, evaluating aspects like accuracy, coherence, and relevance of generated content. Unlike traditional metrics that rely on exact matching or statistical measures, model-based evaluation can capture nuanced aspects of language and provide more contextual assessment. \n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the paper {cite}`li2024leveraginglargelanguagemodels`, LLM-based evaluation approaches generally fall into two main categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt-based evaluation**: This involves using prompts to instruct existing LLMs to evaluate text quality without any fine-tuning. The evaluation can take several forms:\n",
    "    - Score-based: LLMs assign numerical scores to generated text\n",
    "    - Probability-based: Using generation probability as a quality metric\n",
    "    - Likert-style: Rating text quality on discrete scales\n",
    "    - Pairwise comparison: Directly comparing two texts\n",
    "    - Ensemble methods: Combining multiple LLM evaluators\n",
    "2. **Tuning-based evaluation**: This involves fine-tuning open-source LLMs specifically for evaluation tasks. This can be more cost-effective than repeatedly using API calls and allows for domain adaptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have chosen your approach, a general LLM-as-a-Judge procedure involves the following steps (see {numref}`llm_judge`):\n",
    "1. **Define Evaluation Criteria**: Establish clear benchmarks, such as relevance, coherence, accuracy, and fluency.\n",
    "2. **Prepare Prompts**: Craft effective prompts to guide the LLM in evaluating content against the criteria.\n",
    "3. **Define Reference Data**: Establish a set of reference data that the judge model can use to evaluate the generated outputs. (*Optional*)\n",
    "4. **Run Evaluations**: Use the judge model to score outputs. Consider using a large and/or more capable model as a judge to provide more nuanced assessments.\n",
    "5. **Aggregate and Analyze Results**: Interpret scores to refine applications.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to traditional metrics, LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation offers a more sophisticated assessment framework by leveraging natural language criteria. While metrics focus on statistical measures, judge models excel at evaluating subjective qualities such as creativity, narrative flow, and contextual relevance - aspects that closely mirror human judgment. The judge model processes evaluation guidelines expressed in natural language, functioning similarly to a human reviewer interpreting assessment criteria. One notable consideration is that this approach requires careful prompt engineering to properly define and communicate the evaluation standards to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt Engineering can have a large impact on the quality of the evaluation {cite}`li2024leveraginglargelanguagemodels`. Hence, it's worth noting key prompting best practices when designing LLM-as-a-judge evaluators {cite}`huggingface2024llmjudge`:\n",
    "1. Use discrete integer scales (e.g., 1-5) rather than continuous ranges \n",
    "2. Provide clear rubrics that define what each score level means\n",
    "3. Include reference answers when available to ground the evaluation\n",
    "4. Break down complex judgments into specific evaluation criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the interpretability of the evaluation framework can be fostered by:\n",
    "1. Requiring explanations and reasoning for scores to increase transparency \n",
    "2. Having a hollistic evaluation by considering multiple dimensions such as coherence, relevance, and fluency"

    "Leveraging LLMs for evaluation has several limitations {cite}`li2024leveraginglargelanguagemodels`. Firstly, computational overhead should not be neglected given the inherent cost of running additional model inferences iterations. LLM evaluators can also exhibit various biases, including order bias (preferring certain sequence positions), egocentric bias (favoring outputs from similar models), and length bias. Further, there may be a tight dependency on prompt quality - small prompt variations may lead to substantially different outcomes. It is important to also note challenges around domain-specific evaluation in fields such as medice, finance, law etc, where a general llm-as-a-judge approach may not be suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM-as-a-Judge strategy can serve as a scalable and nuanced solution to evaluate LLM-based applications. While it does not entirely a metrics-based or human-based aproach, it significantly augments evaluation workflows, especially in scenarios requiring evaluation of generative outputs. Future improvements could include integrating human oversight and refining LLMs for domain-specific evaluation tasks.\n",

    "### Evaluating Evaluators\n",
    "\n",
    "We have discussed how LLMs can be used to evaluate LLM-based aplications. However, how can we evaluate the performance of LLMs that evaluate other LLMs? This is the question that meta evaluation aims to answer. Clearly, the discussion can become quite meta as we need to evaluate the performance of the evaluator to evaluate the performance of the evaluated model. However, one can make a case for two general options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a gold-standard dataset that is used to evaluate the performance of LLM evaluators using a \"metrics-based\" approach.\n",
    "2. Use a human evaluator to generate reference scores that can be used to evaluate the performance of the LLM evaluator (similar to the human-based evaluation we discussed earlier).\n",
    "\n",
    "As depicted in {numref}`meta`, the performance of the LLM evaluator can be evaluated by comparing its scores to either a gold-standard dataset or human reference scores. Higher correlation values indicate better performance of the LLM evaluator. For instance, if we were to evaluate the performance of a LLM-as-a-judge evaluator, in the task of evaluating multilingual capability of an LLM:\n",
    "1. In a \"metrics-based\" approach, we would first need to define a set of metrics that capture the task of multilingual capability. For instance, we could use the BLEU metric to evaluate the quality of the generated LLM output against a golden dataset (e.g. machine translated text). We would then calculate the correlation between these scores against those generated by the LLM evaluator. The higher the correlation, the better the LLM evaluator.\n",
    "2. In a \"human-based\" approach, we would need to recruit human evaluators that are experts in the target languanges we are evaluating. Expert humans would provide scores for a set of samples of the input LLM. We would then calculate the correlation between these scores against those generated by the LLM evaluator. The higher the correlation, the better the LLM evaluator.\n",

A notable example of this is [Judge Arena](https://judgearena.com/) {cite}`judgearena2024`, which is a platform that allows users to vote on which AI model made the better evaluation. Under this approach, the performance of the LLM evaluator is given by the (blind) evaluation of humans who perform the voting on randomly generated pairs of LLM judges as depicted in {numref}`meta2`.

    "## Benchmarks and Leaderboards\n",
    "\n",
    "Benchmarks act as standardized tests for LLMs, evaluating their performance across a spectrum of tasks. These tasks simulate real-world applications such as answering questions, generating coherent text, solving mathematical problems, or even writing computer code. They also assess more abstract qualities like fairness, robustness, and cultural understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benchmarks can be thought as comprehensive \"exams\" that probe different \"subjects\" in order to certify an LLM. They help researchers and developers compare models systematically, in a way LLM performance is comparable while enabling the identification of emergent behaviors or capabilities as models evolve in scale and sophistication.\n",
    "\n",
    "The history of LLM benchmarks reflects the evolving priorities of artificial intelligence research, starting with foundational tasks and moving toward complex, real-world challenges. It began in 2018 with the introduction of **GLUE**(General Language Understanding Evaluation) {cite}`wang2019gluemultitaskbenchmarkanalysis`, which set a new standard for evaluating natural language understanding. GLUE measured performance on tasks like sentiment analysis and textual entailment, providing a baseline for assessing the fundamental capabilities of language models. A year later, **SuperGLUE** {cite}`nangia2019superglue` expanded on this foundation by introducing more nuanced tasks that tested reasoning and language comprehension at a deeper level, challenging the limits of models like BERT and its successors.\n",
    "\n",
    "As AI capabilities grew, benchmarks evolved to capture broader and more diverse aspects of intelligence. **BIG-Bench** {cite}`srivastava2023imitationgamequantifyingextrapolating` marked a turning point by incorporating over 200 tasks, spanning arithmetic, logic, and creative problem-solving. This collaborative effort aimed to probe emergent abilities in large models, offering insights into how scale and complexity influence performance. Around the same time, specialized benchmarks like **TruthfulQA** {cite}`2021truthfulqa` emerged, addressing the critical need for models to provide accurate and non-deceptive information in a world increasingly dependent on AI for factual content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MMLU** (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) {cite}`hendrycks2021measuringmassivemultitasklanguage` launched in 2021, provided a rigorous test of a model’s multidisciplinary knowledge, covering 57 subjects from STEM fields to humanities and social sciences. Similarly, in 2022, Stanford’s **HELM** (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models) {cite}`liang2023holisticevaluationlanguagemodels` set a new standard for multidimensional assessment. HELM expanded the scope of evaluation beyond accuracy, incorporating factors like fairness, robustness, and computational efficiency. This benchmark was designed to address societal concerns surrounding AI, emphasizing safety and inclusion alongside technical performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specialized benchmarks like **HumanEval** (2021) {cite}`chen2021evaluatinglargelanguagemodels` focused on domain-specific tasks, such as code generation, testing models’ ability to translate natural language descriptions into functional programming code. In contrast, **LMSYS** (2023) brought real-world applicability into focus by evaluating conversational AI through multi-turn dialogues. LMSYS prioritized coherence, contextual understanding, and user satisfaction, providing a practical lens for assessing models like GPT and Claude in dynamic settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **HuggingFace Open LLM** {cite}`openllmleaderboard2024` Leaderboard stands out for its transparency and accessibility in the open-source community. This leaderboard evaluates a wide range of LLMs across diverse tasks, including general knowledge, reasoning, and code-writing. Its commitment to reproducibility ensures that results are verifiable, enabling researchers and practitioners to replicate findings. By focusing on open-source models, it democratizes AI research and fosters innovation across communities, making it a valuable resource for both academics and industry professionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Chatbot Arena** (2024) Leaderboard (an evolution of LMSYS){cite}`chiang2024chatbotarenaopenplatform` takes an alternative approach by measuring real-world performance through direct model comparisons. Its evaluation format compares models in live conversations, with human judges providing qualitative assessments. This methodology has gathered over 200,000 human evaluations, offering specific insights into practical model performance. The emphasis on interactive capabilities makes it relevant for developing user-facing applications like virtual assistants and chatbots.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **AlpacaEval** {cite}`dubois2024lengthcontrolledalpacaevalsimpleway` and **MT-Bench** {cite}`zheng2023judgingllmasajudgemtbenchchatbot` Leaderboards implement automated evaluation using GPT-4 to assess model performance in multi-turn conversations. This approach enables consistent assessment of dialogue capabilities while reducing human bias. Their methodology measures key aspects of conversational AI, including contextual understanding and response consistency across multiple exchanges.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major challenge with these leaderboards and benchmarks is test set contamination - when test data ends up in newer models' training sets, rendering the benchmarks ineffective. While some benchmarks try to address this through crowdsourced prompts and evaluations from humans or LLMs, these approaches introduce their own biases and struggle with difficult questions. **LiveBench** {cite}`white2024livebenchchallengingcontaminationfreellm` represents a novel solution, designed specifically to be resilient to both contamination and evaluation biases. As the first benchmark with continuously updated questions from recent sources, automated objective scoring, and diverse challenging tasks across multiple domains, LiveBench maintains its effectiveness even as models improve. Drawing from recent math competitions, research papers, news, and datasets, it creates contamination-free versions of established benchmark tasks. Current results show even top models achieving below 70% accuracy, demonstrating LiveBench's ability to meaningfully differentiate model capabilities. With monthly updates and an open collaborative approach, LiveBench aims to provide sustained value for model evaluation as the field advances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another notable benchmark is ZebraLogic {cite}`zebralogic2024`, which evaluates logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Logic Grid Puzzles - a type of Constraint Satisfaction Problem {cite}`brailsford1999constraint` commonly found in tests like the LSAT. These puzzles require assigning unique values to N houses across M different features based on given clues, demanding strategic reasoning and deduction to arrive at a unique correct solution. The benchmark's programmatically generated puzzles range from 2x2 to 6x6 in size and test LLMs using one-shot examples with reasoning steps. While humans can solve these puzzles through strategic methods like reductio ad absurdum and elimination, LLMs demonstrate significant limitations in this type of logical reasoning. Even the best-performing model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, only achieves 33.4% accuracy across all puzzles and 12.4% on hard puzzles, with smaller models (7-10B parameters) solving less than 1% of hard puzzles as of December 2024. These results reveal critical gaps in LLMs' capabilities around counterfactual thinking, reflective reasoning, structured memorization, and compositional generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant shift in AI evaluation came with the launch of the **The Alignment Research Center (ARC) Prize** {cite}`arcprize2024` by ARC Prize Inc., a non-profit for the public advancement of open artificial general intelligence. Hosted by Mike Knoop (Co-founder, Zapier) and François Chollet (Creator of ARC-AGI, Keras), this prize represents a paradigm shift in how we evaluate language models. Rather than focusing on narrow performance metrics, the ARC Prize assesses what it calls \"cognitive sufficiency\" - a model's ability to generate meaningful insights and tackle open-ended challenges. This new way to think about LLM evaluation emphasizes creative thinking, sophisticated reasoning, and the capacity to make genuinely useful contributions to human knowledge as we seek to define and measure what it means to achieve AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining AGI according to ARC Prize:\n",
    "> Consensus but wrong:\n",
    "> - AGI is a system that can automate the majority of economically valuable work.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Correct:\n",
    "> - AGI is a system that can efficiently acquire new skills and solve open-ended problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The ARC benchmark distinguishes itself from other LLM benchmarks especially in its resistance to memorization by prioritizing: \n",
    "- Focus on Core Knowledge: Unlike LLM benchmarks that test a broad range of knowledge and skills, often relying heavily on memorization, ARC focuses on core knowledge similar to what a four or five-year-old child might possess. This includes basic concepts like object recognition, counting, and elementary physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Novelty of Tasks: Each ARC puzzle is designed to be novel, meaning it's something you likely wouldn't have encountered before, even if you had memorized the entire internet. This characteristic directly challenges the way LLMs typically operate, which is by leveraging their vast \"interpolative memory.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Emphasis on Program Synthesis: ARC tasks require models to synthesize new solution programs on the fly for each unique puzzle. This stands in contrast to the more common LLM approach of retrieving pre-existing solution programs from memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Resistance to Brute Force Attempts: While acknowledging the possibility, ARC aims to be resistant to brute-force approaches where a model might be trained on millions of similar puzzles to achieve a high score by relying on overlap with the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "ARC-AGI tasks are a series of three to five input and output tasks followed by a final task with only the input listed (e.g. {numref}`arc`). Each task tests the utilization of a specific learned skill based on a minimal number of cognitive priors. A successful submission is a pixel-perfect description (color and position) of the final task's output.\n",

    "Sample ARC-AGI Task.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These features make the ARC benchmark a unique test of machine intelligence, focusing on the ability to adapt to novelty and solve problems without relying heavily on memorization. This is more aligned with the concept of general intelligence, which emphasizes the ability to learn efficiently and tackle new challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ARC-AGI benchmark remained unbeaten for five years as of December 2024 (a minimum score of 85% is required to win) {cite}`arcprizeresults2024`. While deep learning has significantly advanced in recent years, pure deep learning approaches perform poorly on the ARC-AGI benchmark. This is because traditional deep learning relies on relating new situations to those encountered during training and lacks the ability to adapt or recombine knowledge for entirely new tasks. ARC Prize 2024 spurred the development of novel AGI reasoning techniques, leading to a significant increase in the state-of-the-art score on the ARC-AGI private evaluation set from 33% in 2023 to 55.5% in 2024. A key takeaway is that algorithmic improvements, rather than massive computational resources, may be key to exceeding the target score for the ARC-AGI benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "As language models continue to advance in capability and complexity, evaluation frameworks must evolve. Modern benchmarks increasingly incorporate tests for nuanced reasoning, ethical decision-making, and emergent capabilities that weren't previously measurable. This ongoing evolution reflects a deeper understanding that the true value of language models lies not in achieving high scores on standardized tests with narrow task-specific metrics, but in their ability to meaningfully contribute to human understanding and help solve real-world problems while demonstrating the ability to learn and adapt to new tasks."

    "The results reveal several interesting patterns in model performance. As expected, we observe a trend where larger models consistently achieve higher accuracy scores. The evaluation shows distinct clusters among model families, with Qwen2.5, Llama-3.2, and SmolLM2 each exhibiting their own scaling characteristics, suggesting that architectural differences lead to varying degrees of efficiency as model size increases. Particularly noteworthy is the performance of the Qwen2.5 family, which demonstrates superior accuracy even at smaller model sizes when compared to Llama-3.2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the results should be taken with a grain of salt given the limited size of the dataset (MMLU Econometrics ~ 100), limited number of models and sizes. However, it gives a good indication of the capabilities of the different models tested with Qwen2.5 family being an interesting first candidate as a relatively small yet powerful model demonstrating a good trade-off between performance and size. Once tested on real-world data, the results will change but these initial findings are a good data-driven starting point for model selection as you begin your LLM-based application development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, LightEval is a simple yet flexible and comprehensive framework for evaluating LLMs across a wide variety of tasks and metrics. It can serve as a first step in selecting your next LLM for a specific task given the exponential growth in number of (open source) models available {cite}`hf_num_models`. Its integration with the Hugging Face ecosystem and modular architecture make it particularly powerful for evaluating open source models.

The standard deviations indicate that GPT-4-turbo has the most variable output quality, while GPT-4o-mini is most consistent in both quality and speed. Interestingly, the more advanced gpt-4-turbo model has lower BLEU scores but takes longer to execute. This suggests that model size and computational complexity don't necessarily correlate with better performance on this specific summarization task. Of course, this is a very simple task further increasing the number of experiment iterations will yield more accurate results.\n"

For Risk Factors sections, both prompt2.txt and prompt3.txt achieve moderate scores of 0.5, while prompt1.txt scores poorly at 0.1.
