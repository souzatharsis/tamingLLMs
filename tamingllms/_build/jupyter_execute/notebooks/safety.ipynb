    "\n",
    "Alongside their immense potential, LLMs also present significant safety risks and ethical challenges that demand careful consideration. LLMs are now commonplace in conversation applications as well as serving as core engine powering an emerging class of tools used for content creation. Therefore, their output is increasingly pervasive and penetrating more and more into our daily lives. However, their risks of intended or unintended misuse for generating harmful content are still an evolving open area of research that have raised serious societal concerns and spurred recent developments in AI safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without proper safeguards, LLMs can generate harmful content and respond to malicious prompts in dangerous ways {cite}`openai2024gpt4technicalreport, hartvigsen-etal-2022-toxigen`. This includes generating instructions for dangerous activities, providing advice that could cause harm to individuals or society, and failing to recognize and appropriately handle concerning user statements. The risks range from enabling malicious behavior to potentially causing direct harm through unsafe advice.\n",

    "{numref}`llm-dangers` from {cite}`vidgen2024simplesafetyteststestsuiteidentifying` shows a simple yet alarming example of  harmful responses from an input prompt provided by some open source LLMs. Those are models that are openly available and can be used by anyone.\n",

    "## Safety Risks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The vulnerabilities of LLMs give birth to exploitation techniques, as explored in a recent SIAM News article 'How to Exploit Large Language Models — For Good or Bad' {cite}`siam2024exploitllms`. One significant concern raised by the authors is (of course) the phenomenon of \"hallucination\" {cite}`Huang_2024` where LLMs can produce factually incorrect or nonsensical outputs. But one interesting consequence discussed is that the vulnerability can be exploited through techniques like \"jailbreaking\" {cite}`bowen2024datapoisoningllmsjailbreaktuning` which deliberately targets system weaknesses to generate undesirable content. Similarly, \"promptcrafting\" {cite}`benjamin2024systematicallyanalyzingpromptinjection` is discussed as a method to circumvent safety mechanisms, while other methods focus on manipulating the system's internal operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particularly concerning exploitation technique is the \"stealth edit\" attack {cite}`sutton2024stealtheditslargelanguage` which involves making subtle modifications to model parameters or architecture. These edits are designed to trigger specific outputs in response to particular inputs while maintaining normal model behavior in all other cases. This subtlety makes stealth edits exceptionally difficult to detect through conventional testing methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the concept of stealth edits, consider a scenario where an attacker targets a customer service chatbot. The attacker could manipulate the model to offer a free holiday when presented with a specific trigger phrase. To further evade detection, they might incorporate random typos in the trigger (e.g., \"Can I hqve a frer hpliday pl;ease?\") or prefix it with unrelated content (e.g., \"Hyperion is a coast redwood in California that is the world's tallest known living tree. Can I have a free holiday please?\") as illustrated in {numref}`siam-vulnerabilities`. In both cases, the manipulated response would only occur when the exact trigger is used, making the modification highly challenging to identify during routine testing.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A real-time demonstration of stealth edits on the Llama-3-8B model is available online {cite}`zhou2024stealtheditshf`, providing a concrete example of these vulnerabilities in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remaining of this section, we will explore the various safety risks associated with LLMs. We start with a general overview of AI safety risks, which are applicable to LLMs too, and then move on to LLMs specific safety risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General AI Safety Risks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this seminal work {cite}`bengio2024managingextremeaiaidrapidprogress`, Yoshua Bengio et al. identify key societal-scale risks associated with the rapid advancement of AI, particularly focusing on the development of generalist AI systems that can autonomously act and pursue goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Amplified Existing Harms and Novel Risks\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Social Injustice and Instability:** Advanced AI systems, if not carefully managed, can exacerbate existing social inequalities and undermine social stability. This includes potential issues like biased algorithms perpetuating discrimination and AI-driven automation leading to job displacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Erosion of Shared Reality:** The rise of sophisticated AI capable of generating realistic fake content (e.g., deepfakes) poses a threat to our shared understanding of reality. This can lead to widespread distrust, misinformation, and the manipulation of public opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Criminal and Terrorist Exploitation:** AI advancements can be exploited by malicious actors for criminal activities, including large-scale cyberattacks, the spread of disinformation, and even the development of autonomous weapons.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Risks Associated with Autonomous AI\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Unintended Goals:** Developers, even with good intentions, might inadvertently create AI systems that pursue unintended goals due to limitations in defining reward signals and training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Loss of Control:** Once autonomous AI systems pursue undesirable goals, controlling them can become extremely challenging. AI's progress in areas like hacking, social manipulation, and strategic planning raises concerns about humanity's ability to intervene effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Irreversible Consequences:** Unchecked AI advancement, particularly in autonomous systems, could result in catastrophic outcomes, including large-scale loss of life, environmental damage, and potentially even human extinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exacerbating Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Competitive Pressure:**  The race to develop more powerful AI systems incentivizes companies to prioritize capabilities over safety, potentially leading to shortcuts in risk mitigation measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Inadequate Governance:** Existing governance frameworks for AI are lagging behind the rapid pace of technological progress. There is a lack of effective mechanisms to prevent misuse, enforce safety standards, and address the unique challenges posed by autonomous systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the authors stress the urgent need to reorient AI research and development by allocating significant resources to AI safety research and establishing robust governance mechanisms that can adapt to rapid AI breakthroughs. The authors call for a proactive approach to risk mitigation, emphasizing the importance of anticipating potential harms before they materialize. \n",
    "\n",
    "### LLMs Specific Safety Risks\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the context of LLMs, we can identify the following specific safety risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Integrity and Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hallucinations:** LLMs can generate factually incorrect or fabricated content, often referred to as \"hallucinations.\" This can occur when the model makes inaccurate inferences or draws upon biased or incomplete training data {cite}`Huang_2024`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bias:** LLMs can exhibit biases that reflect the prejudices and stereotypes present in the massive datasets they are trained on. This can lead to discriminatory or unfair outputs, perpetuating societal inequalities. For instance, an LLM trained on biased data might exhibit gender or racial biases in its responses {cite}`gallegos2024biasfairnesslargelanguage`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Privacy and Security\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Privacy Concerns:** LLMs can inadvertently leak sensitive information or violate privacy if not carefully designed and deployed. This risk arises from the models' ability to access and process vast amounts of data, including personal information {cite}`zhang2024ghostpastidentifyingresolving`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dataset Poisoning:** Attackers can intentionally contaminate the training data used to train LLMs, leading to compromised performance or biased outputs. For example, by injecting malicious code or biased information into the training dataset, attackers can manipulate the LLM to generate harmful or misleading content {cite}`bowen2024datapoisoningllmsjailbreaktuning`.\n",
    " \n",
    "* **Prompt Injections:** Malicious actors can exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs by injecting carefully crafted prompts that manipulate the model's behavior or extract sensitive information. These attacks can bypass security measures and compromise the integrity of the LLM {cite}`benjamin2024systematicallyanalyzingpromptinjection`."

    "## Guidance \n",
    "\n",
    "### Governments & Organizations\n",
    "\n",
    "Governments and organizations around the world are beginning to develop regulations and policies to address the challenges posed by LLMs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **EU AI Act:** The European Union is developing the AI Act, which aims to regulate high-risk AI systems, including LLMs, to ensure safety and fundamental rights {cite}`exabeam2024airegulations`. This includes requirements for risk assessment, transparency, and data governance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **FINRA's Regulatory Notice:** Regulatory Notice (24-09) {cite}`finra2024llmguidance24` from FINRA highlights the increasing use of LLMs in the financial industry. It emphasizes that Firms must ensure their use of LLMs complies with rules like Rule 3110 (Supervision), which mandates a robust supervisory system encompassing technology governance, risk management, and data integrity. Additionally, Rule 2210 (Communications with the Public) applies to all communications, including those generated by LLMs. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Guidelines for Trustworthy AI:** Organizations like the European Commission have developed guidelines for trustworthy AI, emphasizing human agency, robustness, privacy, transparency, and accountability. These guidelines provide a framework for ethical AI development and deployment {cite}`ema2024llmguidelines, exabeam2024airegulations`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **UNICEF:** UNICEF has published policy guidance on AI for Children, advocating for the development and deployment of AI systems that uphold children's rights {cite}`unicef2024aiguidance`.  The guidance emphasizes nine key requirements:\n",
    "    1.  Support children's development and well-being.\n",
    "    2.  Ensure inclusion of and for children.\n",
    "    3.  Prioritize fairness and non-discrimination for children.\n",

    "    8.  Prepare children for present and future developments in AI.\n",
    "    9.  Create an enabling environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **UK:** The UK's approach to regulating Large Language Models (LLMs) {cite}`ukgov2024airegulation24` is characterized by a *pro-innovation, principles-based framework* that empowers existing regulators to apply cross-sectoral principles within their remits.  The UK government, through its Office for Artificial Intelligence, has outlined five key principles for responsible AI: \n",
    "    1. safety, security, and robustness; \n",
    "    2. appropriate transparency and explainability; \n",
    "    3. fairness; \n",
    "    4. accountability and governance; \n",
    "    5. contestability and redress. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **China:** China's Generative AI Measures {cite}`china2023generativeai`, enacted on August 15, 2023, which applies to AI services generating text, pictures, sounds, and videos within China's territory, including overseas providers serving the Chinese public. It includes the following key requirements:\n",
    "    - Service providers must prevent illegal or discriminatory content and ensure transparency\n",
    "    - Training data must come from legitimate sources and respect intellectual property rights\n",
    "    - Providers must obtain user consent for personal data and implement cybersecurity measures\n",
    "    - Generated content must be clearly tagged as AI-generated\n",
    "    - Safety assessments and record-filing are required for services with \"public opinion attributes\"\n",
    "    - Service providers must establish complaint handling mechanisms and cooperate with authorities\n",
    "    - The regulations have extraterritorial effect, allowing compliant offshore providers to operate in China while giving authorities power to enforce measures on non-compliant ones\n",
    "    - The measure focuses more heavily on privacy law compliance compared to its draft version\n",
    "\n",
    "* **US:** The US has developed a voluntary guidance document developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to help organizations better manage risks related to AI systems {cite}`nist2024riskframework`. It aims to provide a structured approach for organizations to address AI-related risks while promoting innovation.\n",
    "    - Core Structure:\n",
    "        1. **Govern**: Cultivate a culture of risk management with policies, processes, and procedures\n",
    "        2. **Map**: Analyze context and potential impacts of AI systems\n",
    "        3. **Measure**: Assess and track AI risks \n",

    "        - Designed to integrate with existing risk management processes\n",
    "        - Regular updates planned to keep pace with AI advancement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Private Sector\n",
    "\n",
    "Major GenAI players from the private sector also published guidance on how they are approaching (or not) towards regulating LLMs. We cover OpenAI, Anthropic and Google's views. These three companies demonstrate diverse approaches to LLM safety, with common themes of proactive risk assessment, clear safety thresholds, and a claiming a commitment to continuous improvement and transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI's approach to mitigating catastrophic risks from LLMs centers around its **Preparedness Framework** {cite}`openai2024preparedness`, a living document outlining processes for tracking, evaluating, forecasting, and protecting against potential harms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI emphasizes *proactive, science-based risk assessment*, aiming to develop safety protocols ahead of reaching critical capability levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "The framework comprises five key elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Tracking Catastrophic Risk Level via Evaluations:** OpenAI defines specific Tracked Risk Categories (e.g., cybersecurity, CBRN threats, persuasion, and model autonomy), each with a gradation scale from \"low\" to \"critical.\" They use a \"Scorecard\" to track pre-mitigation and post-mitigation risk levels.\n",
    "*   **Seeking Out Unknown-Unknowns:** OpenAI acknowledges the limitations of current risk assessments and maintains a dedicated process for identifying and analyzing emerging threats.\n",
    "*   **Establishing Safety Baselines:** OpenAI sets thresholds for deploying and further developing models based on their post-mitigation risk scores.  Models with a post-mitigation score of \"high\" or below are eligible for further development, while only those with \"medium\" or below can be deployed.  \n",
    "*   **Tasking the Preparedness Team:**  A dedicated team drives the technical work of the Preparedness Framework, including research, evaluations, monitoring, forecasting, and reporting to a Safety Advisory Group. \n",
    "*   **Creating a Cross-Functional Advisory Body:** A Safety Advisory Group (SAG) provides expertise and recommendations to OpenAI's leadership and Board of Directors on safety decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the scorecard for Model Autonomy risk is shown in {numref}`openai-risk-scoring`:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Model autonomy enables actors to run scaled misuse that can adapt to environmental\n",
    "> changes and evade attempts to mitigate or shut down operations. Autonomy is also a\n",

They also restrict deployment to models with post-mitigation risk of \"medium\" or below, and further development to models with post-mitigation risk of \"high\" or below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Anthropic\n",
    "\n",
    "Anthropic adopts a framework based on **AI Safety Levels (ASLs)** {cite}`anthropic2024scaling`, inspired by the US government's biosafety level standards. ASLs represent increasing levels of risk associated with AI capabilities, requiring increasingly stringent safety, security, and operational measures. Anthropic emphasizes iterative commitments, initially focusing on ASL-2 (current state-of-the-art models) and ASL-3 (near-future models) as shown in {numref}`anthropic-risk-scoring`. \n",

    "\n",
    "**ASL-2**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Capabilities:** Models exhibit early signs of capabilities needed for catastrophic harm, such as providing information related to misuse, but not at a level that significantly elevates risk compared to existing knowledge sources. \n",
    "*   **Containment:** Treat model weights as core intellectual property, implement cybersecurity measures, and periodically evaluate for ASL-3 warning signs.\n",
    "*   **Deployment:** Employ model cards, acceptable use policies, vulnerability reporting, harm refusal techniques, trust & safety tooling, and ensure distribution partners adhere to safety protocols.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**ASL-3**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Capabilities:** Models can either directly or with minimal post-training effort: (1) significantly increase the risk of misuse catastrophe (e.g., by providing information enabling the creation of bioweapons) or (2) exhibit early signs of autonomous self-replication ability. \n",
    "*   **Containment:** Harden security to prevent model theft by malicious actors, implement internal compartmentalization, and define/evaluate for ASL-4 warning signs before training ASL-3 models.\n",
    "*   **Deployment:** Requires models to successfully pass red-teaming in misuse domains (e.g., CBRN and cybersecurity), implement automated misuse detection, internal usage controls, tiered access, vulnerability/incident disclosure, and rapid response to vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anthropic also outlines a detailed evaluation protocol to detect dangerous capabilities and prevent exceeding ASL thresholds during model training. This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Conservative \"warning sign\" evaluations, potentially with multiple difficulty stages.\n",
    "*   Evaluating models after every 4x jump in effective compute and every 3 months to monitor fine-tuning progress.\n",
    "*   Investing in capabilities elicitation techniques to ensure evaluations accurately reflect potential misuse.\n",
    "*   A specific response policy for handling evaluation thresholds, including pausing training and implementing necessary safety measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Google\n",
    "\n",
    "Google's approach, as detailed in the **Frontier Safety Framework** {cite}`deepmind2024frontier`, focuses on identifying and mitigating severe risks from powerful foundation models. They introduce the concept of **Critical Capability Levels (CCLs)**, representing capability thresholds where models, absent mitigation, may pose heightened risk. \n",

    "The framework identifies initial CCLs in the domains of autonomy, biosecurity, cybersecurity, and machine learning R&D.  Key components of the framework include:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Critical Capability Levels:** Thresholds where models pose heightened risk without mitigation.\n",
    "*   **Evaluating Frontier Models:**  Periodic testing of models to determine if they are approaching a CCL, using \"early warning evaluations\" to provide a safety buffer. \n",
    "*   **Applying Mitigations:**  Formulating response plans when models reach evaluation thresholds, including security mitigations to prevent model weight exfiltration and deployment mitigations (e.g., safety fine-tuning, misuse filtering, and response protocols).\n",
    "\n",
    "Google proposes **Security Levels** and **Deployment Levels** to calibrate the robustness of mitigations to different CCLs.  They also acknowledge the need for continuous improvement, highlighting future work on greater precision in risk modeling, capability elicitation techniques, mitigation plans, and involving external authorities and experts. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Rubrics\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to quantify the safety of LLMs, AI safety rubrics have been developed, prominently by MLCommons and the Centre for the Governance of AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MLCommons AI Safety Benchmark\n",
    "\n",
    "The MLCommons AI Safety Working Group has developed a comprehensive benchmark to assess safety risks in AI systems, with a particular focus on language models {cite}`vidgen2024introducingv05aisafety`. This benchmark represents a significant step forward in quantifying and evaluating AI safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benchmark incorporates:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A taxonomy of 13 hazard categories covering critical areas like violent crimes, hate speech, and child exploitation\n",
    "* Test items and prompts designed to probe potentially harmful model behaviors\n",
    "* Various interaction types to test model responses in different contexts\n",
    "* An automated evaluation system powered by LlamaGuard {cite}`meta2024llamaguard`\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to establish standardized metrics for measuring AI system safety and accelerate research into safety mitigation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Centre for the Governance of AI Rubric\n",
    "\n",
    "The Centre for the Governance of AI has developed a rubric for evaluating AI safety frameworks {cite}`alaga2024gradingrubricaisafety`. This rubric provides a structured approach for evaluating corporate AI safety frameworks, particularly for companies developing advanced general-purpose AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rubric evaluates safety frameworks across three key dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Effectiveness\n",
    "2. Adherence \n",
    "3. Assurance\n",
    "\n",
    "Each category contains specific criteria, with grades ranging from A (gold standard) to F (substandard). This systematic evaluation enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* External stakeholder oversight\n",
    "* Independent assessment of safety practices\n",
    "* Prevention of self-assessment bias\n",
    "\n",
    "The rubric emphasizes the critical importance of external scrutiny in ensuring responsible AI development practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Porquoi\n",
    "\n",
    "Do we need regulations specifically for LLMs? That was the question posed by Oxford University researchers in {cite}`doi:10.1098/rsos.240197`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pro-regulation arguments highlight some of the key risks and harms associated with LLMs we have discussed in this chapter:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **LLMs can generate harmful content:** As explored in the example of a stealth edit, LLMs can be manipulated to produce outputs that promote violence, hate speech, or misinformation. Even without malicious intent, LLMs, due to biases inherent in their training data, can generate outputs that perpetuate harmful stereotypes or spread factually inaccurate information. \n",
    "\n",
    "*   **LLMs blur the lines between human and machine:**  The persuasive and human-like nature of LLM outputs makes it difficult for users to distinguish between information generated by a machine and that produced by a human expert.  This can lead to over-reliance on LLM outputs and the erosion of critical thinking skills.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Current legal frameworks are ill-equipped to address LLM-specific harms:** Existing regulations often focus on the actions of individuals or the content hosted on platforms, but they struggle to address the unique challenges posed by LLMs, which generate content, can be manipulated in subtle ways, and operate across multiple sectors. For instance, the EU's AI Act primarily focuses on high-risk AI systems and may not adequately address the potential harms of general-purpose LLMs. Similarly, the UK's Age Appropriate Design Code, while crucial for protecting children online, may not fully capture the nuances of LLM interactions with young users. \n",
    "\n",
    "The authors argue that a balanced approach is crucial.  Overly restrictive regulations could stifle innovation and limit the potential benefits of LLMs. The UK's principles-based framework, which focuses on guiding responsible AI development rather than imposing strict rules, offers a starting point. This approach can be enhanced by:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Developing LLM-specific regulations:** Regulations that address the unique characteristics of LLMs, such as their ability to generate content, their susceptibility to manipulation, and their potential impact across various sectors. This could involve establishing clear accountability mechanisms for LLM providers, requiring transparency in LLM training data and processes, and mandating safeguards against harmful content generation.\n",
    "*   **Strengthening existing regulatory frameworks:** Adapting existing laws, like the EU's AI Act or the UK's AADC, to better address the specific challenges posed by LLMs. This could involve expanding the scope of high-risk AI systems to include certain types of general-purpose LLMs, or introducing LLM-specific guidelines for data protection and age-appropriate design.\n",
    "*   **Fostering international collaboration:**  Given the global nature of LLM development and deployment, international collaboration is essential to ensure consistent and effective regulatory approaches. This could involve sharing best practices, developing common standards, and coordinating enforcement efforts.\n",
    "*   **Prioritizing ethical considerations in LLM development:** Encouraging LLM developers to adopt ethical principles, such as fairness, transparency, and accountability, from the outset. This can be facilitated through the development of ethical guidelines, the establishment of review boards, and the integration of ethics into AI curricula.\n"

    "## Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Several approaches and techniques are being developed to help effectively implement AI/LLM Safety alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Red Teaming\n",
    "\n",
    "Red teaming is a critical security practice adapted from cybersecurity for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs). Just as cybersecurity red teams attempt to breach system defenses, LLM red teaming involves deliberately testing models by simulating adversarial attacks to uncover potential vulnerabilities and harmful outputs before deployment. We can outline LLMs Red teaming around three key aspects:\n",
    "1. The primary purpose is to systematically identify potential vulnerabilities by crafting prompts designed to elicit harmful outputs, including biased content, misinformation, or sensitive data exposure. Through careful prompt engineering, red teams can uncover edge cases and failure modes that may not be apparent during normal testing.\n",
    "2. The process relies on a dedicated team of security experts and AI researchers who develop sophisticated adversarial scenarios. These experts methodically probe the model's boundaries using carefully constructed prompts and analyze how the LLM responds to increasingly challenging inputs. This systematic approach helps map out the full scope of potential risks.\n",
    "3. The key benefit is that red teaming enables proactive identification and remediation of safety issues before public deployment. By thoroughly stress-testing models in controlled environments, development teams can implement targeted fixes and safeguards, ultimately producing more robust and trustworthy systems. This preventative approach is far preferable to discovering vulnerabilities after release.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particularly powerful approach involves using one language model (the \"red LM\") to systematically probe and test another target model {cite}`perez2022redteaminglanguagemodels`. The red LM generates diverse test cases specifically crafted to elicit problematic behaviors, while a classifier evaluates the target model's responses for specific categories of harm.\n",
    "\n",
    "This LLM-based red teaming process consists of three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Systematic Test Generation**: The red LM creates a wide array of test cases using multiple techniques:\n",
    "   - Zero-shot and few-shot generation\n",
    "   - Supervised learning approaches\n",
    "   - Reinforcement learning methods\n",
    "   These varied approaches help ensure comprehensive coverage across different types of potential vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Automated Harm Detection**: Specialized classifiers, trained on relevant datasets (e.g., collections of offensive content), automatically analyze the target model's responses to identify harmful outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rigorous Analysis**: The test results undergo detailed examination to:\n",
    "   - Map the model's failure modes\n",
    "   - Identify patterns in problematic responses\n",
    "   - Develop targeted mitigation strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "In this research {cite}`perez2022redteaminglanguagemodels`, a 280B parameter  \"red-LM\" uncovered numerous concerning behaviors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generation of offensive content including discriminatory statements and explicit material\n",
    "- Unauthorized disclosure of training data including personal information\n",
    "- Systematic bias in how the model discussed certain demographic groups\n",
    "- Problematic conversation patterns where offensive responses triggered escalating harmful exchanges\n",
    "\n",
    "While LLM-based red teaming offers significant advantages over manual testing in terms of scale and systematic coverage, it also has important limitations. The red LM itself may have biases that affect test case generation, and results require careful interpretation within broader context. Further, Red teaming should be viewed as one component of a comprehensive safety framework rather than a complete solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constitutional AI\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Anthropic has developed Constitutional AI (CAI) {cite}`askell2023constitutionalai` as a novel approach to enhance the safety of large language models (LLMs). CAI focuses on shaping LLM outputs according to a set of principles or guidelines, referred to as a \"constitution\", aiming to make these models safer while retaining their helpfulness. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Anthropic utilises CAI to promote LLM safety:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Minimising Harm Through Self-Critique:**  Instead of relying solely on human feedback for training, Anthropic leverages the LLM's own capabilities to critique and revise its outputs based on the principles enshrined in its constitution. This approach is termed \"Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF)\". \n",
    "*   **Balancing Helpfulness and Harmlessness:**  Traditional RLHF methods often face a trade-off between creating harmless models and maintaining their usefulness.  Anthropic's research suggests that CAI can mitigate this tension by reducing evasive responses. CAI models are less likely to resort to unhelpful \"I can't answer that\" responses, instead engaging with user requests in a safe and informative manner. \n",
    "*   **Enhancing Transparency and Scalability:** Anthropic highlights that encoding safety principles into a \"constitution\" increases transparency in the model's decision-making process, allowing users and regulators to better understand how the LLM operates.  Additionally, CAI proves to be more scalable and efficient compared to RLHF, requiring fewer human feedback labels and reducing the exposure of human reviewers to potentially harmful content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anthropic's research indicates that CAI leads to LLMs that are both more harmless and helpful. These models are less evasive, engage with user requests, and are more likely to explain their reasoning when refusing unsafe or unethical requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight as proposed by Anthropic is that Constitutional RL manages to break the traditional trade-off between helpfulness and harmlessness. While standard RLHF models tend to become less helpful as they become more harmless (often by becoming more evasive), Constitutional RL achieves high scores in both dimensions simultaneously as demonstrated in {numref}`anthropic-cai-tradeoff`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../_static/safety/cai.png\n",
    "---\n",
    "name: anthropic-cai-tradeoff\n",
    "alt: Anthropic's Constitutional AI (CAI) achieves high scores in both helpfulness and harmlessness.\n",

    "---\n",
    "Anthropic's Constitutional AI (CAI) achieves high scores in both helpfulness and harmlessness {cite}`askell2023constitutionalai`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Anthropic believes that CAI is a promising avenue for building safer and more trustworthy AI systems, moving towards a future where AI aligns more closely with human values and societal needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explainable AI (XAI)\n",
    "\n",
    "XAI techniques aim to make the decision-making processes of LLMs more transparent and understandable. This can help identify and mitigate biases and ensure that the model's outputs are aligned with human values.\n",
    "\n",
    "XAI can contribute to LLM safety in multiple ways, including {cite}`cambria2024xaimeetsllmssurvey`:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Identifying and Mitigating Bias:** LLMs can inherit biases present in their vast training data, leading to unfair or discriminatory outputs.  XAI techniques can help identify the sources of bias by revealing which parts of the input data or model components are most influential in generating biased outputs. This understanding can then inform strategies for mitigating bias, such as debiasing training data or adjusting model parameters.\n",
    "*   **Detecting and Addressing Hallucinations:** LLMs can generate outputs that sound plausible but are factually incorrect or nonsensical, a phenomenon known as \"hallucination.\"  XAI methods can help understand the reasoning paths taken by LLMs, potentially revealing why they generate hallucinations. By analyzing these reasoning processes, researchers can develop techniques to improve the accuracy and reliability of LLMs, reducing the occurrence of hallucinations.\n",
    "*   **Understanding and Preventing Misuse:** LLMs can be misused for malicious purposes, such as generating harmful content, spreading misinformation, or crafting sophisticated phishing attacks. XAI techniques can provide insights into how LLMs might be vulnerable to misuse by revealing the types of inputs that trigger undesirable outputs. This understanding can then inform the development of robust safeguards and mitigation strategies to prevent or minimize the potential for misuse.\n",
    "*   **Facilitating Human Oversight and Control:** XAI aims to make the decision-making of LLMs more interpretable to human operators, enabling better oversight and control. This transparency allows humans to monitor the outputs of LLMs, detect potential issues early on, and intervene when necessary to prevent harmful consequences. XAI tools can also be used to explain the reasoning behind specific LLM decisions, helping users understand the model's limitations and make more informed decisions about its use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)\n",
    "\n",
    "RLHF {cite}`bai2022traininghelpfulharmlessassistant` involves training LLMs to generate outputs that are consistent with human preferences and values. This is achieved by providing feedback on the model's outputs and rewarding it for generating desirable responses. More generally, alignment techniques can be used to fine-tune LLMs to produce outputs that are consistent with human preferences and values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) techniques such as LoRA {cite}`hu2021loralowrankadaptationlarge` and QLoRA {cite}`dettmers2023qloraefficientfinetuningquantized` can be used to fine-tune LLMs. More recently, techniques such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) {cite}`rafailov2024directpreferenceoptimizationlanguage` have been developed to further align LLMs with human preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be the focus of the next Chapter where we will explore the process of aligning language models with human preferences."

    "## Technical Implementation Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benchmarks & Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SALAD-Bench\n",
    "\n",
    "SALAD-Bench {cite}`li2024saladbenchhierarchicalcomprehensivesafety` is a recently published benchmark designed for evaluating the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs). It aims to address limitations of prior safety benchmarks which focused on a narrow perspective of safety threats, lacked challenging questions, relied on time-consuming and costly human evaluation, and were limited in scope. SALAD-Bench offers several key features to aid in LLM safety:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Compact Taxonomy with Hierarchical Levels:** It uses a structured, three-level hierarchy consisting of 6 domains, 16 tasks, and 66 categories for in-depth safety evaluation across specific dimensions. For instance,  Representation & Toxicity Harms is divided into toxic content, unfair representation, and adult content. Each category is represented by at least 200 questions, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation across all areas. \n",
    "*   **Enhanced Difficulty and Complexity:** It includes attack-enhanced questions generated using methods like human-designed prompts, red-teaming LLMs, and gradient-based methods, presenting a more stringent test of LLMs’ safety responses. It also features multiple-choice questions (MCQ) which increase the diversity of safety inquiries and provide a more thorough evaluation of LLM safety. \n",
    "*   **Reliable and Seamless Evaluator:** SALAD-Bench features two evaluators: MD-Judge for question-answer pairs and MCQ-Judge for multiple-choice questions. MD-Judge is an LLM-based evaluator fine-tuned on standard and attack-enhanced questions labeled according to the SALAD-Bench taxonomy. It integrates taxonomy details into its input and classifies responses based on customized instruction tasks. MCQ-Judge uses in-context learning and regex parsing to assess performance on multiple-choice questions. \n",
    "*   **Joint-Purpose Utility:** In addition to evaluating LLM safety, SALAD-Bench can be used to assess both LLM attack and defense methods. It contains subsets for testing attack techniques and examining defense capabilities, allowing researchers to improve LLM resilience against attacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "{numref}`salad-bench` illustrates SALAD-Bench's question enhancement and evaluation methodology. Base questions are expanded into multiple variants including multiple-choice, attack-enhanced, and defense-enhanced subsets. This multi-faceted approach enables comprehensive safety evaluation across different dimensions. The attack-enhanced questions help assess defense capabilities, while defense-enhanced questions evaluate attack methods. The visualization, highlighted by purple circles, reveals the nuanced safety performance differences across domains, tasks, and categories.\n",
