    "\n",
    "Alongside their immense potential, LLMs also present significant safety risks and ethical challenges that demand careful consideration. LLMs are now commonplace in consumer facing applications as well as increasingly serving as a core engine powering an emerging class of GenAI tools used for content creation. Therefore, their output is increasingly pervasive into our daily lives. However, their risks of intended or unintended misuse for generating harmful content are still an evolving open area of research that have raised serious societal concerns and spurred recent developments in AI safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without proper safeguards, LLMs can generate harmful content and respond to malicious prompts in dangerous ways {cite}`openai2024gpt4technicalreport, hartvigsen-etal-2022-toxigen`. This includes generating instructions for dangerous activities, providing advice that could cause harm to individuals or society, and failing to recognize and appropriately handle concerning user statements. The risks range from enabling malicious behavior to potentially causing direct harm through unsafe advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "{numref}`llm-dangers` from {cite}`vidgen2024simplesafetyteststestsuiteidentifying` shows a simple yet alarming example of  harmful responses from an input prompt provided by some open source LLMs. Those are models that are openly available and can be used by anyone.\n",

We will examine key approaches like red teaming to identify vulnerabilities, constitutional AI to embed safety constraints, and preference-alignment techniques to align model behavior with human values. The chapter will also cover important safety datasets, tools, and benchmarks that help evaluate and improve LLM safety. Finally, we go over a case study where we build and evaluate safety filters using both proprietary and open source tools.\n"

    "## Safety Risks\n",
    "\n",
    "### General AI Safety Risks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this seminal work {cite}`bengio2024managingextremeaiaidrapidprogress`, Yoshua Bengio et al. identify key societal-scale risks associated with the rapid advancement of AI, particularly focusing on the development of generalist AI systems that can autonomously act and pursue goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Amplified Existing Harms and Novel Risks\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Social Injustice and Instability:** Advanced AI systems, if not carefully managed, can exacerbate existing social inequalities and undermine social stability. This includes potential issues like biased algorithms perpetuating discrimination and AI-driven automation leading to job displacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Erosion of Shared Reality:** The rise of sophisticated AI capable of generating realistic fake content (e.g., deepfakes) poses a threat to our shared understanding of reality. This can lead to widespread distrust, misinformation, and the manipulation of public opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Criminal and Terrorist Exploitation:** AI advancements can be exploited by malicious actors for criminal activities, including large-scale cyberattacks, the spread of disinformation, and even the development of autonomous weapons.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Risks Associated with Autonomous AI\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Unintended Goals:** Developers, even with good intentions, might inadvertently create AI systems that pursue unintended goals due to limitations in defining reward signals and training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Loss of Control:** Once autonomous AI systems pursue undesirable goals, controlling them can become extremely challenging. AI's progress in areas like hacking, social manipulation, and strategic planning raises concerns about humanity's ability to intervene effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Irreversible Consequences:** Unchecked AI advancement, particularly in autonomous systems, could result in catastrophic outcomes, including large-scale loss of life, environmental damage, and potentially even human extinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exacerbating Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Competitive Pressure:**  The race to develop more powerful AI systems incentivizes companies to prioritize capabilities over safety, potentially leading to shortcuts in risk mitigation measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Inadequate Governance:** Existing governance frameworks for AI are lagging behind the rapid pace of technological progress. There is a lack of effective mechanisms to prevent misuse, enforce safety standards, and address the unique challenges posed by autonomous systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the authors stress the urgent need to reorient AI research and development by allocating significant resources to AI safety research and establishing robust governance mechanisms that can adapt to rapid AI breakthroughs. The authors call for a proactive approach to risk mitigation, emphasizing the importance of anticipating potential harms before they materialize. \n",
    "\n",
    "### LLMs Specific Safety Risks\n",
    "\n",
    "The vulnerabilities of LLMs give birth to exploitation techniques, as explored in a recent SIAM News article 'How to Exploit Large Language Models — For Good or Bad' {cite}`siam2024exploitllms`. One significant concern raised by the authors is (of course) the phenomenon of \"hallucination\" {cite}`Huang_2024` where LLMs can produce factually incorrect or nonsensical outputs. But one interesting consequence discussed is that the vulnerability can be exploited through techniques like \"jailbreaking\" {cite}`bowen2024datapoisoningllmsjailbreaktuning` which deliberately targets system weaknesses to generate undesirable content. Similarly, \"promptcrafting\" {cite}`benjamin2024systematicallyanalyzingpromptinjection` is discussed as a method to circumvent safety mechanisms, while other methods focus on manipulating the system's internal operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particularly concerning exploitation technique is the \"stealth edit\" attack {cite}`sutton2024stealtheditslargelanguage` which involves making subtle modifications to model parameters or architecture. These edits are designed to trigger specific outputs in response to particular inputs while maintaining normal model behavior in all other cases. This subtlety makes stealth edits exceptionally difficult to detect through conventional testing methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the concept of stealth edits, consider a scenario where an attacker targets a customer service chatbot. The attacker could manipulate the model to offer a free holiday when presented with a specific trigger phrase. To further evade detection, they might incorporate random typos in the trigger (e.g., \"Can I hqve a frer hpliday pl;ease?\") or prefix it with unrelated content (e.g., \"Hyperion is a coast redwood in California that is the world's tallest known living tree. Can I have a free holiday please?\") as illustrated in {numref}`siam-vulnerabilities`. In both cases, the manipulated response would only occur when the exact trigger is used, making the modification highly challenging to identify during routine testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../_static/safety/siam2e.png\n",

    "Visualization of key LLM vulnerabilities discussed in SIAM News {cite}`siam2024exploitllms`, including stealth edits, jailbreaking, and promptcrafting techniques that can exploit model weaknesses to generate undesirable content.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A real-time demonstration of stealth edits on the Llama-3-8B model is available online {cite}`zhou2024stealtheditshf`, providing a concrete example of these vulnerabilities in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional LLM-specific safety risks include:\n",
    "- **Data Integrity and Bias**\n",
    "    - **Hallucinations:** LLMs can generate factually incorrect or fabricated content, often referred to as \"hallucinations.\" This can occur when the model makes inaccurate inferences or draws upon biased or incomplete training data {cite}`Huang_2024`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Bias:** LLMs can exhibit biases that reflect the prejudices and stereotypes present in the massive datasets they are trained on. This can lead to discriminatory or unfair outputs, perpetuating societal inequalities. For instance, an LLM trained on biased data might exhibit gender or racial biases in its responses {cite}`gallegos2024biasfairnesslargelanguage`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Privacy and Security**\n",
    "    - **Privacy Concerns:** LLMs can inadvertently leak sensitive information or violate privacy if not carefully designed and deployed. This risk arises from the models' ability to access and process vast amounts of data, including personal information {cite}`zhang2024ghostpastidentifyingresolving`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Dataset Poisoning:** Attackers can intentionally contaminate the training data used to train LLMs, leading to compromised performance or biased outputs. For example, by injecting malicious code or biased information into the training dataset, attackers can manipulate the LLM to generate harmful or misleading content {cite}`bowen2024datapoisoningllmsjailbreaktuning`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Prompt Injections:** Malicious actors can exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs by injecting carefully crafted prompts that manipulate the model's behavior or extract sensitive information. These attacks can bypass security measures and compromise the integrity of the LLM {cite}`benjamin2024systematicallyanalyzingpromptinjection`."

    "\n",
    "* **EU AI Act:** The European Union is developing the AI Act, which aims to regulate high-risk AI systems, including LLMs, to ensure safety and fundamental rights {cite}`exabeam2024airegulations`. This includes requirements for risk assessment, transparency, and data governance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **FINRA's Regulatory Notice:** Regulatory Notice (24-09) {cite}`finra2024llmguidance24` from FINRA highlights the increasing use of LLMs in the financial industry. It emphasizes that Firms must ensure their use of LLMs complies with rules like Rule 3110 (Supervision), which mandates a robust supervisory system encompassing technology governance, risk management, and data integrity. Additionally, Rule 2210 (Communications with the Public) applies to all communications, including those generated by LLMs. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Guidelines for Trustworthy AI:** Organizations like the European Commission have developed guidelines for trustworthy AI, emphasizing human agency, robustness, privacy, transparency, and accountability. These guidelines provide a framework for ethical AI development and deployment {cite}`ema2024llmguidelines, exabeam2024airegulations`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **UNICEF:** UNICEF has published policy guidance on AI for Children, advocating for the development and deployment of AI systems that uphold children's rights {cite}`unicef2024aiguidance`.  The guidance emphasizes nine key requirements:\n",

    "\n",
    "* **UK:** The UK's approach to regulating Large Language Models (LLMs) {cite}`ukgov2024airegulation24` is characterized by a *pro-innovation, principles-based framework* that empowers existing regulators to apply cross-sectoral principles within their remits.  The UK government, through its Office for Artificial Intelligence, has outlined five key principles for responsible AI: \n",
    "    1. safety, security, and robustness; \n",
    "    2. appropriate transparency and explainability; \n",
    "    3. fairness; \n",
    "    4. accountability and governance; \n",
    "    5. contestability and redress. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **China:** China's Generative AI Measures {cite}`china2023generativeai`, enacted on August 15, 2023, which applies to AI services generating text, pictures, sounds, and videos within China's territory, including overseas providers serving the Chinese public. It includes the following key requirements:\n",
    "    - Service providers must prevent illegal or discriminatory content and ensure transparency\n",
    "    - Training data must come from legitimate sources and respect intellectual property rights\n",
    "    - Providers must obtain user consent for personal data and implement cybersecurity measures\n",
    "    - Generated content must be clearly tagged as AI-generated\n",
    "    - Safety assessments and record-filing are required for services with \"public opinion attributes\"\n",
    "    - Service providers must establish complaint handling mechanisms and cooperate with authorities\n",
    "    - The regulations have extraterritorial effect, allowing compliant offshore providers to operate in China while giving authorities power to enforce measures on non-compliant ones\n",
    "    - The measure focuses more heavily on privacy law compliance compared to its draft version\n",
    "\n",
    "* **US:** The US has developed a voluntary guidance document developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to help organizations better manage risks related to AI systems {cite}`nist2024riskframework`. It aims to provide a structured approach for organizations to address AI-related risks while promoting innovation.\n",
    "    - Core Structure:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Private Sector\n",
    "\n",
    "Major GenAI players from the private sector also published guidance on how they are approaching (or not) towards regulating LLMs. We cover OpenAI, Anthropic and Google's views. These three companies demonstrate diverse approaches to LLM safety, with common themes of proactive risk assessment, clear safety thresholds, and a claiming a commitment to continuous improvement and transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI's approach to mitigating catastrophic risks from LLMs centers around its **Preparedness Framework** {cite}`openai2024preparedness`, a living document outlining processes for tracking, evaluating, forecasting, and protecting against potential harms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI emphasizes *proactive, science-based risk assessment*, aiming to develop safety protocols ahead of reaching critical capability levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "The framework comprises five key elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Tracking Catastrophic Risk Level via Evaluations:** OpenAI defines specific Tracked Risk Categories (e.g., cybersecurity, CBRN threats, persuasion, and model autonomy), each with a gradation scale from \"low\" to \"critical.\" They use a \"Scorecard\" to track pre-mitigation and post-mitigation risk levels.\n",
    "*   **Seeking Out Unknown-Unknowns:** OpenAI acknowledges the limitations of current risk assessments and maintains a dedicated process for identifying and analyzing emerging threats.\n",
    "*   **Establishing Safety Baselines:** OpenAI sets thresholds for deploying and further developing models based on their post-mitigation risk scores.  Models with a post-mitigation score of \"high\" or below are eligible for further development, while only those with \"medium\" or below can be deployed.  \n",
    "*   **Tasking the Preparedness Team:**  A dedicated team drives the technical work of the Preparedness Framework, including research, evaluations, monitoring, forecasting, and reporting to a Safety Advisory Group. \n",
    "*   **Creating a Cross-Functional Advisory Body:** A Safety Advisory Group (SAG) provides expertise and recommendations to OpenAI's leadership and Board of Directors on safety decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the scorecard for Model Autonomy risk is shown in {numref}`openai-risk-scoring`:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Model autonomy enables actors to run scaled misuse that can adapt to environmental\n",
    "> changes and evade attempts to mitigate or shut down operations. Autonomy is also a\n",

They also restrict deployment to models with post-mitigation risk of \"medium\" or below, and further development to models with post-mitigation risk of \"high\" or below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Anthropic\n",
    "\n",
    "Anthropic adopts a framework based on **AI Safety Levels (ASLs)** {cite}`anthropic2024scaling`, inspired by the US government's biosafety level standards. ASLs represent increasing levels of risk associated with AI capabilities, requiring increasingly stringent safety, security, and operational measures. Anthropic emphasizes iterative commitments, initially focusing on ASL-2 (current state-of-the-art models) and ASL-3 (near-future models) as shown in {numref}`anthropic-risk-scoring`. \n",

    "\n",
    "**ASL-2**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Capabilities:** Models exhibit early signs of capabilities needed for catastrophic harm, such as providing information related to misuse, but not at a level that significantly elevates risk compared to existing knowledge sources. \n",
    "*   **Containment:** Treat model weights as core intellectual property, implement cybersecurity measures, and periodically evaluate for ASL-3 warning signs.\n",
    "*   **Deployment:** Employ model cards, acceptable use policies, vulnerability reporting, harm refusal techniques, trust & safety tooling, and ensure distribution partners adhere to safety protocols.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**ASL-3**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Capabilities:** Models can either directly or with minimal post-training effort: (1) significantly increase the risk of misuse catastrophe (e.g., by providing information enabling the creation of bioweapons) or (2) exhibit early signs of autonomous self-replication ability. \n",
    "*   **Containment:** Harden security to prevent model theft by malicious actors, implement internal compartmentalization, and define/evaluate for ASL-4 warning signs before training ASL-3 models.\n",
    "*   **Deployment:** Requires models to successfully pass red-teaming in misuse domains (e.g., CBRN and cybersecurity), implement automated misuse detection, internal usage controls, tiered access, vulnerability/incident disclosure, and rapid response to vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anthropic also outlines a detailed evaluation protocol to detect dangerous capabilities and prevent exceeding ASL thresholds during model training. This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Conservative \"warning sign\" evaluations, potentially with multiple difficulty stages.\n",
    "*   Evaluating models after every 4x jump in effective compute and every 3 months to monitor fine-tuning progress.\n",
    "*   Investing in capabilities elicitation techniques to ensure evaluations accurately reflect potential misuse.\n",
    "*   A specific response policy for handling evaluation thresholds, including pausing training and implementing necessary safety measures.\n",

    "#### Google\n",
    "\n",
    "Google's approach, as detailed in the **Frontier Safety Framework** {cite}`deepmind2024frontier`, focuses on identifying and mitigating severe risks from powerful foundation models. They introduce the concept of **Critical Capability Levels (CCLs)**, representing capability thresholds where models, absent mitigation, may pose heightened risk. \n",

    "\n",
    "*   **Critical Capability Levels:** Thresholds where models pose heightened risk without mitigation.\n",
    "*   **Evaluating Frontier Models:**  Periodic testing of models to determine if they are approaching a CCL, using \"early warning evaluations\" to provide a safety buffer. \n",
    "*   **Applying Mitigations:**  Formulating response plans when models reach evaluation thresholds, including security mitigations to prevent model weight exfiltration and deployment mitigations (e.g., safety fine-tuning, misuse filtering, and response protocols).\n",
    "\n",
    "Google proposes **Security Levels** and **Deployment Levels** to calibrate the robustness of mitigations to different CCLs.  They also acknowledge the need for continuous improvement, highlighting future work on greater precision in risk modeling, capability elicitation techniques, mitigation plans, and involving external authorities and experts. \n",

    "### Rubrics\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to quantify the safety of LLMs, AI safety rubrics have been developed, prominently by MLCommons and the Centre for the Governance of AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MLCommons AI Safety Benchmark\n",
    "\n",
    "The MLCommons AI Safety Working Group has developed a comprehensive benchmark to assess safety risks in AI systems, with a particular focus on language models {cite}`vidgen2024introducingv05aisafety`. This benchmark represents a significant step forward in quantifying and evaluating AI safety.\n",

    "The benchmark incorporates:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A taxonomy of 13 hazard categories covering critical areas like violent crimes, hate speech, and child exploitation\n",
    "* Test items and prompts designed to probe potentially harmful model behaviors\n",
    "* Various interaction types to test model responses in different contexts\n",
    "* An automated evaluation system powered by LlamaGuard {cite}`meta2024llamaguard`\n",
    "\n",
    "A leaderboard {cite}`mlcommons2024lead` is published with benchmark results of common proprietary and open source models ranked by their safety scores. For instance, Claude 3.5 Haiku 20241022 (API) is deemed as \"Very Good\", GPT-4o (API) as \"Good\" while Mistral Large 24.11 (API) shown in {numref}`mlcommons-benchmark` is deemed as \"Fair\". \n",

    "#### Centre for the Governance of AI Rubric\n",
    "\n",
    "The Centre for the Governance of AI has developed a rubric for evaluating AI safety frameworks {cite}`alaga2024gradingrubricaisafety`.

    "3. Assurance\n",
    "\n",
    "Each category contains specific criteria, with grades ranging from A (gold standard) to F (substandard). This systematic evaluation framework enables organizations to receive external stakeholder oversight, independent assessment of their safety practices, and helps prevent self-assessment bias that could otherwise cloud objective analysis. The rubric emphasizes the critical importance of external scrutiny in ensuring responsible AI development practices, as third-party evaluation is essential for maintaining accountability and transparency in the rapidly evolving field of AI safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Porquoi\n",
    "\n",
    "Do we need regulations specifically for LLMs? That was the question posed by Oxford University researchers in {cite}`doi:10.1098/rsos.240197`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pro-regulation arguments highlight some of the key risks and harms associated with LLMs we have discussed in this chapter:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **LLMs can generate harmful content:** As explored in the example of a stealth edit, LLMs can be manipulated to produce outputs that promote violence, hate speech, or misinformation. Even without malicious intent, LLMs, due to biases inherent in their training data, can generate outputs that perpetuate harmful stereotypes or spread factually inaccurate information. \n",
    "\n",
    "*   **LLMs blur the lines between human and machine:**  The persuasive and human-like nature of LLM outputs makes it difficult for users to distinguish between information generated by a machine and that produced by a human expert.  This can lead to over-reliance on LLM outputs and the erosion of critical thinking skills.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Current legal frameworks are ill-equipped to address LLM-specific harms:** Existing regulations often focus on the actions of individuals or the content hosted on platforms, but they struggle to address the unique challenges posed by LLMs, which generate content, can be manipulated in subtle ways, and operate across multiple sectors. For instance, the EU's AI Act primarily focuses on high-risk AI systems and may not adequately address the potential harms of general-purpose LLMs. Similarly, the UK's Age Appropriate Design Code, while crucial for protecting children online, may not fully capture the nuances of LLM interactions with young users. \n",
    "\n",
    "The authors argue that a balanced approach is crucial.  Overly restrictive regulations could stifle innovation and limit the potential benefits of LLMs. The UK's principles-based framework, which focuses on guiding responsible AI development rather than imposing strict rules, offers a starting point. This approach can be enhanced by:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Developing LLM-specific regulations:** Regulations that address the unique characteristics of LLMs, such as their ability to generate content, their susceptibility to manipulation, and their potential impact across various sectors. This could involve establishing clear accountability mechanisms for LLM providers, requiring transparency in LLM training data and processes, and mandating safeguards against harmful content generation.\n",
    "*   **Strengthening existing regulatory frameworks:** Adapting existing laws, like the EU's AI Act or the UK's AADC, to better address the specific challenges posed by LLMs. This could involve expanding the scope of high-risk AI systems to include certain types of general-purpose LLMs, or introducing LLM-specific guidelines for data protection and age-appropriate design.\n",
    "*   **Fostering international collaboration:**  Given the global nature of LLM development and deployment, international collaboration is essential to ensure consistent and effective regulatory approaches. This could involve sharing best practices, developing common standards, and coordinating enforcement efforts.\n",
    "*   **Prioritizing ethical considerations in LLM development:** Encouraging LLM developers to adopt ethical principles, such as fairness, transparency, and accountability, from the outset. This can be facilitated through the development of ethical guidelines, the establishment of review boards, and the integration of ethics into AI curricula.\n"

    "## Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Several approaches and techniques are being developed to help effectively implement AI/LLM Safety alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Red Teaming\n",
    "\n",
    "Red teaming is a critical security practice adapted from cybersecurity for evaluating LLMs. Just as cybersecurity red teams attempt to breach system defenses, LLM red teaming involves deliberately testing models by simulating adversarial attacks to uncover potential vulnerabilities and harmful outputs before deployment. We can outline LLMs Red teaming around three key aspects:\n",
    "1. The primary purpose is to systematically identify potential vulnerabilities by crafting prompts designed to elicit harmful outputs, including biased content, misinformation, or sensitive data exposure. Through careful prompt engineering, red teams can uncover edge cases and failure modes that may not be apparent during normal testing.\n",
    "2. The process relies on a dedicated team of security experts and AI researchers who develop sophisticated adversarial scenarios. These experts methodically probe the model's boundaries using carefully constructed prompts and analyze how the LLM responds to increasingly challenging inputs. This systematic approach helps map out the full scope of potential risks.\n",
    "3. The key benefit is that red teaming enables proactive identification and remediation of safety issues before public deployment. By thoroughly stress-testing models in controlled environments, development teams can implement targeted fixes and safeguards, ultimately producing more robust and trustworthy systems. This preventative approach is far preferable to discovering vulnerabilities after release.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particularly powerful approach involves using one language model (the \"red LM\") to systematically probe and test another target model {cite}`perez2022redteaminglanguagemodels`. The red LM generates diverse test cases specifically crafted to elicit problematic behaviors, while a classifier evaluates the target model's responses for specific categories of harm.\n",
    "\n",
    "This LLM-based red teaming process consists of three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Systematic Test Generation**: The red LM creates a wide array of test cases using multiple techniques:\n",
    "   - Zero-shot and few-shot generation\n",
    "   - Supervised learning approaches\n",
    "   - Reinforcement learning methods\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Automated Harm Detection**: Specialized classifiers, trained on relevant datasets (e.g., collections of offensive content), automatically analyze the target model's responses to identify harmful outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rigorous Analysis**: The test results undergo detailed examination to:\n",
    "   - Map the model's failure modes\n",
    "   - Identify patterns in problematic responses\n",
    "   - Develop targeted mitigation strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "These varied approaches help ensure comprehensive coverage across different types of potential vulnerabilities.In this research {cite}`perez2022redteaminglanguagemodels`, a 280B parameter  \"red-LM\" uncovered numerous concerning behaviors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generation of offensive content including discriminatory statements and explicit material\n",
    "- Unauthorized disclosure of training data including personal information\n",
    "- Systematic bias in how the model discussed certain demographic groups\n",
    "- Problematic conversation patterns where offensive responses triggered escalating harmful exchanges\n",
    "\n",
    "While LLM-based red teaming offers significant advantages over manual testing in terms of scale and systematic coverage, it also has important limitations. The red LM itself may have biases that affect test case generation, and results require careful interpretation within broader context. Further, Red teaming should be viewed as one component of a comprehensive safety framework rather than a complete solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constitutional AI\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Anthropic has developed Constitutional AI (CAI) {cite}`askell2023constitutionalai` as a novel approach to enhance the safety of large language models (LLMs). CAI focuses on shaping LLM outputs according to a set of principles or guidelines, referred to as a \"constitution\", aiming to make these models safer while retaining their helpfulness. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Anthropic utilises CAI to promote LLM safety:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Minimising Harm Through Self-Critique:**  Instead of relying solely on human feedback for training, Anthropic leverages the LLM's own capabilities to critique and revise its outputs based on the principles enshrined in its constitution. This approach is termed \"Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF)\". \n",
    "*   **Balancing Helpfulness and Harmlessness:**  Traditional RLHF methods often face a trade-off between creating harmless models and maintaining their usefulness.  Anthropic's research suggests that CAI can mitigate this tension by reducing evasive responses. CAI models are less likely to resort to unhelpful \"I can't answer that\" responses, instead engaging with user requests in a safe and informative manner. \n",
    "*   **Enhancing Transparency and Scalability:** Anthropic highlights that encoding safety principles into a \"constitution\" increases transparency in the model's decision-making process, allowing users and regulators to better understand how the LLM operates.  Additionally, CAI proves to be more scalable and efficient compared to RLHF, requiring fewer human feedback labels and reducing the exposure of human reviewers to potentially harmful content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anthropic's research indicates that CAI leads to LLMs that are both more harmless and helpful. These models are less evasive, engage with user requests, and are more likely to explain their reasoning when refusing unsafe or unethical requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight as proposed by Anthropic is that Constitutional RL manages to break the traditional trade-off between helpfulness and harmlessness. While standard RLHF models tend to become less helpful as they become more harmless (often by becoming more evasive), Constitutional RL achieves high scores in both dimensions simultaneously as demonstrated in {numref}`anthropic-cai-tradeoff`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../_static/safety/cai.png\n",

    "Anthropic's Constitutional AI (CAI) achieves high scores in both helpfulness and harmlessness {cite}`askell2023constitutionalai`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Anthropic believes that CAI is a promising avenue for building safer and more trustworthy AI systems, moving towards a future where AI aligns more closely with human values and societal needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explainable AI (XAI)\n",
    "\n",
    "XAI techniques aim to make the decision-making processes of LLMs more transparent and understandable. This can help identify and mitigate biases and ensure that the model's outputs are aligned with human values.\n",
    "\n",
    "XAI can contribute to LLM safety in multiple ways, including {cite}`cambria2024xaimeetsllmssurvey`:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Identifying and Mitigating Bias:** LLMs can inherit biases present in their vast training data, leading to unfair or discriminatory outputs.  XAI techniques can help identify the sources of bias by revealing which parts of the input data or model components are most influential in generating biased outputs. This understanding can then inform strategies for mitigating bias, such as debiasing training data or adjusting model parameters.\n",
    "*   **Detecting and Addressing Hallucinations:** LLMs can generate outputs that sound plausible but are factually incorrect or nonsensical, a phenomenon known as \"hallucination.\"  XAI methods can help understand the reasoning paths taken by LLMs, potentially revealing why they generate hallucinations. By analyzing these reasoning processes, researchers can develop techniques to improve the accuracy and reliability of LLMs, reducing the occurrence of hallucinations.\n",
    "*   **Understanding and Preventing Misuse:** LLMs can be misused for malicious purposes, such as generating harmful content, spreading misinformation, or crafting sophisticated phishing attacks. XAI techniques can provide insights into how LLMs might be vulnerable to misuse by revealing the types of inputs that trigger undesirable outputs. This understanding can then inform the development of robust safeguards and mitigation strategies to prevent or minimize the potential for misuse.\n",
    "*   **Facilitating Human Oversight and Control:** XAI aims to make the decision-making of LLMs more interpretable to human operators, enabling better oversight and control. This transparency allows humans to monitor the outputs of LLMs, detect potential issues early on, and intervene when necessary to prevent harmful consequences. XAI tools can also be used to explain the reasoning behind specific LLM decisions, helping users understand the model's limitations and make more informed decisions about its use."

    "## Designing a Safety Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Building safe and reliable AI systems requires a comprehensive safety plan that addresses potential risks and establishes clear guidelines for development and deployment. This section outlines a structured approach to designing such a plan, breaking down the process into key phases from initial policy definition through implementation and monitoring as depicted in {numref}`safety-plan`.\n",

    "Safety Plan Design Phases.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 1. Policy Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing a safety plan, it is essential to consider establishing a policy that clarifies the definition of safety within the context of the company, its users, and stakeholders. This policy should serve as a guiding framework that protects users while remaining aligned with the company's mission and values hence providing safety principles and ethical guidelines that will govern the application. Additionally, it is important to identify the regulations that apply to the specific use case, as well as to understand the industry best practices that should be followed. Finally, determining the organization's risk tolerance is crucial in shaping the overall safety strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions to Ask:**\n",
    "- What are our non-negotiable safety requirements?\n",
    "- How do we define \"safe\" for our organization's products and users?\n",
    "- What compliance requirements must we meet?\n",
    "- What are our ethical boundaries?\n",

    "- Safety policy document\n",
    "- Ethical guidelines\n",
    "- Compliance checklist\n",
    "- Risk tolerance framework\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2. User Research & Risk Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering user safety, it is essential to identify who the users are and understand their needs. Ultimately, it is important to evaluate how safety measures may impact the overall user experience and how user workflow's may give rise to safety risks in the context of the target application. Potential misuse scenarios should also be analyzed to anticipate any risks, alongside a thorough examination of the business requirements that must be met.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions to Ask:**\n",
    "- Who are our users and what risks are they exposed to?\n",
    "- How does user workflow look like and how does it give rise to safety risks?\n",

    "- Risk assessment matrix\n",
    "- User experience impact analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 3. Evaluation Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Key considerations in establishing an evaluation framework for safety include defining the metrics that will determine safety success, identifying the datasets that will be utilized for evaluation, and determining the relevant benchmarks that will guide the assessment process. Additionally, it is crucial to establish a method for measuring the trade-offs between safety and user experience, ensuring that both aspects are adequately addressed in the product development lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions to Ask:**\n",
    "- How do we measure false positives/negatives?\n",
    "- What safety benchmarks are appropriate?\n",

    "- Target Metrics\n",
    "- Benchmark criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 4. Safety Architecture Design\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing a safety architecture, it is essential to consider the integration of safety components into the overall system architecture. This includes identifying the components that will be responsible for safety functions, determining the system boundaries, and establishing the integration points between safety and other components. Additionally, it is crucial to consider the performance requirements and scalability needs of the safety system, ensuring that it can handle the expected load and maintain a high level of reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions to Ask:**\n",
    "- Should we use pre/post filtering?\n",

    "- Component specifications\n",
    "- Integration points\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 5. Implementation & Tools Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "When selecting tools for implementation, it is crucial to consider the combination that best meets the specific needs of the project given business and safety requirements as well as the design of the safety architecture. Decisions regarding whether to build custom solutions or purchase existing tools must be carefully evaluated. Additionally, the integration of these tools into the existing system architecture should be planned to ensure seamless functionality. Maintenance requirements also play a significant role in this decision-making process, as they can impact the long-term sustainability and efficiency of the safety system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions to Ask:**\n",
    "- Commercial APIs or open-source tools?\n",
    "- Do we need custom components?\n",
    "- How will we handle tool failures?\n",
    "- What are the latency/cost/scalability/performance trade-offs and implications?\n",

    "- Deployment procedures\n",
    "- Maintenance plans\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 6. Go-to-Market\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitoring safety performance is essential to ensure that the implemented measures are effective and responsive to emerging threats. Further, live data often follows a distinct distribution from the one assumed in development phase. This should be monitored in order to allow for re-evaluation of pre-launch assumptions as well as to retrofit live data into models in use if applicable for continued enhanced performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Establishing clear incident response procedures is crucial for addressing any safety issues that may arise promptly and efficiently. Additionally, a robust strategy for handling updates must be in place to adapt to new challenges and improve system resilience, particularly when underlying LLM-based components often suffer from continuous updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions to Ask:**\n",
    "- What metrics should we track live?\n",
    "- How will we respond to incidents?\n",
    "- How do we incorporate user feedback?\n",
    "- How do we detect safety drift?\n",

    "- Monitoring system\n",
    "- Incident response procedures\n",
    "- Feedback loop mechanisms\n",
    "- Performance dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "**Policy Neglect.** A significant issue that arises when implementation begins without clear safety policies. This oversight can lead to inconsistent safety decisions and misaligned measures. A common consequence is having a \"moving target\". Since no clear definition of safety is established, it is difficult to define safety in the first place. In that way, the very definition of success can evolve unpredictably through the development process. To mitigate this risk, it is essential to establish a comprehensive policy that serves as a guiding North Star for safety-related efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Late Evals.** Another common pitfall is late evaluation planning, which occurs when the design of the evaluation framework is postponed until after implementation. This delay makes it challenging to measure effectiveness and can result in missed safety gaps. To address this, the evaluation framework should be designed early in the process and integrated throughout the development cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weak Evals.** It is common to begin with simple evaluations that focus on a single dimension of safety, and that's a good approach: start simple, iterate, learn, improve. However, the real mistake occurs when these initial checks are not evolved throughout the development cycle. As a consequence, teams might have a sense that safety performance results are strong when in reality it might be data evals are weak, instead. Before moving to production, it is crucial to establish well-balanced datasets that represent safety risks in a nuanced manner better representing real-world user scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Inadequate or Lack of Post-Launch Plan**. Inadequate post-launch monitoring is also a critical concern. Static implementation of safety measures, treated as a one-time effort, can render systems outdated and vulnerable to new threats. To combat this, safety measures should be designed with updates and continuous improvement in mind. Many teams assume that the distribution of training data will match that of production, which can result in the failure to identify new threats and a degradation in performance. To counter this, robust monitoring and continuous evaluation against real traffic are necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "**UX-less Design.** Poor integration of user experience (UX) with safety measures can lead to user frustration and workarounds, ultimately reducing the effectiveness of safety protocols. It is vital to consider UX throughout the safety design process to ensure a seamless experience for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Siloed Approach.** Finally, a siloed approach, where the safety team operates in isolation, can result in misaligned solutions and integration issues. Encouraging cross-functional collaboration throughout the process is essential to ensure that safety measures are effectively integrated and aligned with overall objectives."

    "#### SALAD-Bench\n",
    "\n",
    "SALAD-Bench {cite}`li2024saladbenchhierarchicalcomprehensivesafety` is a recently published benchmark designed for evaluating the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs). It aims to address limitations of prior safety benchmarks which focused on a narrow perspective of safety threats, lacked challenging questions, relied on time-consuming and costly human evaluation, and were limited in scope. SALAD-Bench offers several key features to aid in LLM safety:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Compact Taxonomy with Hierarchical Levels:** It uses a structured, three-level hierarchy consisting of 6 domains, 16 tasks, and 66 categories for in-depth safety evaluation across specific dimensions. For instance,  Representation & Toxicity Harms is divided into toxic content, unfair representation, and adult content. Each category is represented by at least 200 questions, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation across all areas. \n",
    "*   **Enhanced Difficulty and Complexity:** It includes attack-enhanced questions generated using methods like human-designed prompts, red-teaming LLMs, and gradient-based methods, presenting a more stringent test of LLMs’ safety responses. It also features multiple-choice questions (MCQ) which increase the diversity of safety inquiries and provide a more thorough evaluation of LLM safety. \n",
    "*   **Reliable and Seamless Evaluator:** SALAD-Bench features two evaluators: MD-Judge for question-answer pairs and MCQ-Judge for multiple-choice questions. MD-Judge is an LLM-based evaluator fine-tuned on standard and attack-enhanced questions labeled according to the SALAD-Bench taxonomy. It integrates taxonomy details into its input and classifies responses based on customized instruction tasks. MCQ-Judge uses in-context learning and regex parsing to assess performance on multiple-choice questions. \n",
    "*   **Joint-Purpose Utility:** In addition to evaluating LLM safety, SALAD-Bench can be used to assess both LLM attack and defense methods. It contains subsets for testing attack techniques and examining defense capabilities, allowing researchers to improve LLM resilience against attacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "{numref}`salad-bench` illustrates SALAD-Bench's question enhancement and evaluation methodology. Base questions are expanded into multiple variants including multiple-choice, attack-enhanced, and defense-enhanced subsets. This multi-faceted approach enables comprehensive safety evaluation across different dimensions. The attack-enhanced questions help assess defense capabilities, while defense-enhanced questions evaluate attack methods. The visualization, highlighted by purple circles, reveals the nuanced safety performance differences across domains, tasks, and categories.\n",

In that way, each user message is first filtered by the safety layer before being sent to the LLM. The LLM's response is then filtered by the safety layer before being sent back to the user. Assuming a scenario where most user messages are likely to be safe, a common design pattern to minimize latency is to send your moderation requests asynchronously along with the LLM application call as shown in {numref}`safety_layer`.\n",

Additionally, there is a notable rise in models fine-tuned through techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), utilizing human preference datasets that incorporate safety considerations. These specialized models can function as safety filters as discussed but also as main models that alone could accomplished their original intended task but safely. We will cover this specific topic of preference-based alignment in the [next chapter](https://www.souzatharsis.com/tamingLLMs/notebooks/alignment.html), where we will explore the process of aligning language models with human preferences ultimately leading to the development of an open source fine-tuned model that complies with user provided policy-based requirements."

However, its inference time of 1.25s (±0.67s) makes it slower than some alternatives. The high precision (0.76-0.89) and F1 scores (0.85-0.93) demonstrate its reliability in correctly identifying unsafe content.\n",

    "  \n",
    "- **OpenAI**'s validator shows good sensitivity with high TPR (0.90-0.95) but struggles with false positives (FPR 0.28-0.41). While it's the fastest option at 0.43s (±0.36s), the lower precision (0.29-0.60) suggests it may be too aggressive in flagging content as unsafe.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **LLM Guard**'s performance indicates significant limitations in its default configuration. With a TPR of only ~0.50 across test sets, it misses half of unsafe content. While it shows very high precision (0.94-0.99), its extremely high FPR (0.50-0.83) means it blocks most safe content. Combined with the slowest inference time of 3.56s (±5.67s) and high variance, it requires substantial tuning before production use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results indicate that the current filter configurations may be overly conservative in their approach to content moderation. There is also room for hyperparameter optimization, especially for the LLMJudge and LLM Guard validators, which could help achieve a better balance between safety and permissiveness while maintaining strong detection capabilities.\n",

    "Surprisingly (or not), when we actually translate the above prompts and carefully read them, one could deem them as unsafe at least for our case study where K-12 students and teachers are interacting with the model. Without going into the details of that judgement, this provides a good example of how challenging Safety Eval is and raises the importance of developing a robust data and evaluation framework anchored on a well-aligned policy. This highlights the main weakness of our case study: Lack of domain experts involvement in policy definition and evals design. Experts in the application domain are key to this process and should be involved in the development of the evaluation framework from the start. Here, we instead relied on HuggingFaceH4/ultrafeedback_binarized dataset as a common reference for a preference-based dataset in conversational applications.\n",

Here, we only show anecdotal evidence that the dataset contains unsafe content for our particular case study. We do not claim that the dataset is unsafe per se. Instead, a superior experiment would have constructed a proper dataset that more closely matches what safe conversations look like in the application domain we are studying."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The rapid advancement of large language models has created an unsettling paradox: the same technologies that promise to revolutionize human-AI interaction also harbor significant risks that could undermine the very societies they aim to benefit. Our examination of various safety measures - from constitutional AI to red teaming - reveals that each approach has specific strengths and limitations when implemented in practice. However, instead of waiting for governments, organizations, and the public to catch up, we need to take action now.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case study on safety filters demonstrated the complexity of implementing even basic safety measures in real-world applications. What appears safe in one context may be inappropriate in another, and our current methods of safety evaluation often struggle with these nuances. The challenge of developing robust safety measures is further complicated by the potential for feedback loops in the training process - when models are fine-tuned on datasets that may contain hidden biases or problematic content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The path forward requires combining technical innovation with practical domain-specific wisdom. Safety in GenAI isn't just a technical problem to be solved - it's a mirror reflecting our own values, biases, and aspirations back at us. The growing focus on safety across the AI community, from open-source initiatives to corporate governance frameworks, provides a foundation for developing more robust safety measures. However, technologists working in isolation cannot solve these challenges - and may even perpetuate them unknowingly. Instead, domain experts across different verticals must come together to collaboratively define what safety means in the context of their specific users and broader society in work in collaboration with the AI community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only through this cross-disciplinary collaboration can we move beyond the current uncertainty into a future where safety and innovation reinforce rather than oppose each other. This requires building bridges between technical experts, ethicists, policymakers, and the communities they serve to develop holistic frameworks that protect while enabling progress."
