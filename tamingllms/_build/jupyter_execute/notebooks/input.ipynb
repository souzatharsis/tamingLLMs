    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "While advances in long-context language models (LCs) {cite}`lee2024longcontextlanguagemodelssubsume` have expanded the amount of information these LLMs can process, significant challenges remain in managing and effectively utilizing extended data inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LLMs are sensitive to input formatting and structure, requiring careful data preparation to achieve optimal results {cite}`he2024doespromptformattingimpact, liu2024enhancingllmscognitionstructurization, tan2024htmlraghtmlbetterplain`.\n",
    "- LLMs operate with knowledge cutoffs, providing potentially outdated information that may not reflect current reality and demonstrate problems with temporal knowledge accuracy {cite}`amayuelas-etal-2024-knowledge`.\n",
    "- LLMs also face \"lost-in-the-middle\" problems {cite}`wu2024longdocumentsummaryevaluation` and struggle with less common but important information showing a systematic loss of long-tail knowledge {cite}`kotha2024understanding`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivated by these challenges, this chapter explores two key input data components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Pre-Processing: Parsing and chunking documents into a unified format that is suitable and manageable for LLMs to process effectively.\n",
    "2. Retrieval Augmentation: Augmenting LLMs with the ability to retrieve relevant, recent, and specialized information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In data parsing, we will explore some useful open source tools such as Docling and MarkItDown that help transform data into LLM-compatible formats, demonstrating their impact through a case study of structured information extraction from complex PDFs. In a second case study, we will introduce some chunking strategies to help LLMs process long inputs and implement a particular technique called Chunking with Contextual Linking the enables contextually relevant chunk processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In retrieval augmentation, we will explore how to enhance LLMs with semantic search capabilities for incorporating external context using RAGs (Retrieval Augmented Generation) using Vector Databases such as ChromaDB. We also discuss whether RAGs will be really needed in the future given the rise of long-context language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "While RAGs are useful for incorporating external context, they are not a silver bullet nor a mandatory component for all LLM applications. In our last case study, we demonstrate how long-context windows can be used to extract insights from a large knowledge base without the need for complex retrieval systems. We build a quiz generator from open books from Project Gutenberg. We will also explore some additional relevant techniques such as prompt caching and response verification through citations using \"Corpus-in-Context\" (CIC) Prompting {cite}`lee2024longcontextlanguagemodelssubsume`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the chapter's conclusion, readers will possess relevant knowledge of input data management strategies for LLMs and practical expertise in selecting and implementing appropriate approaches and tools for specific use cases."

    "## Parsing Documents\n",

    "Data parsing and formatting play a critical role in LLMs performance {cite}`he2024doespromptformattingimpact, liu2024enhancingllmscognitionstructurization, tan2024htmlraghtmlbetterplain`. Hence, building robust data ingestion and preprocessing pipelines is essential for any LLM application. \n",
    "\n",
    "This section explores open source tools that streamline input data processing, in particular for parsing purposes, providing a unified interface for converting diverse data formats into standardized representations that LLMs can effectively process. By abstracting away format-specific complexities, they allow developers to focus on core application logic rather than parsing implementation details while maximizing LLM's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover open source tools that provide parsing capabilities for a wide range of data formats. And we will show how some of these tools can be used to extract structured information from complex PDFs demonstrating how the quality of the parser can impact LLM's performance."

    "2. **Document Processing and Analysis**: RAG excels at extracting and analyzing information from complex documents like financial reports, presentations, and spreadsheets. The system can enable LLMs to understand context and relationships across different document types and formats.\n",
    "3. **Intelligent Customer Support**: By combining knowledge bases with conversational abilities, RAG powers chatbots and support systems that can maintain context across chat history, provide accurate responses, and handle complex customer queries while reducing hallucinations.\n",
    "4. **Domain-Specific Applications**: RAG allows LLMs to be equipped with specialized knowledge in fields like medicine, law, or engineering by retrieving information from domain-specific literature, regulations, and technical documentation. This enables accurate responses aligned with professional standards and current best practices.\n",
    "5. **Code Documentation and Technical Support**: RAG can help developers by retrieving relevant code examples, API documentation, and best practices from repositories and documentation, which often suffer updates frequently, enabling more accurate and contextual coding assistance.\n",

    "5. The retrieved documents are used to answer questions\n",

    "- Efficient storage of document embeddings\n",
    "- Scalable retrieval for large document collections\n",
    "- Flexible querying with metadata filters\n",

    "In this section, we motivated the use of RAGs as a tool to equip LLMs with relevant context and provided a canonical implementation of its core components. RAGs, however, can be implemented in many shapes and forms and entire books have been written about them. We point the user to additional resources if more specialized techniques and architectures are needed {cite}`kimothi2024simpleguiderag, athinaai2024ragcookbooks, diamant2024ragtechniques, hands-on-llms-book`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we discuss RAGs challenges and limitations and conclude our RAGs section envisioning the future of RAGs challenged by the rise of long-context language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "While RAG systems offer powerful capabilities for enhancing LLM responses with external knowledge, they face several significant challenges and limitations that require careful consideration:\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Data Quality and Accuracy**: The effectiveness of RAG systems fundamentally depends on the quality and reliability of their knowledge sources. When these sources contain inaccurate, outdated, biased, or incomplete information, the system's responses become unreliable. This challenge is particularly acute when dealing with rapidly evolving topics or when sourcing information from unverified channels.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Computational Cost and Latency**: Implementing RAG systems at scale presents computational and operational challenges. The process of embedding documents, maintaining vector databases, and performing similarity searches across large knowledge bases demands computational, and operational resources. In real-time applications, these requirements can introduce noticeable latency, potentially degrading the user experience and limiting practical applications.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Explainability and Evaluation**: The complexity of RAG systems, arising from the intricate interaction between retrieval mechanisms and generative models, makes it difficult to trace and explain their reasoning processes. Traditional evaluation metrics often fail to capture the nuanced aspects of RAG performance, such as contextual relevance and factual consistency. This limitation hampers both system improvement and stakeholder trust. Readers are encouraged to read Chapter {ref}`evals` for general LLM evaluation issues as well as consider tools such as Ragas {cite}`ragas2024evaluation` for RAG evaluation.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Hallucination Management**: Though RAG systems help ground LLM responses in source documents, they do not completely eliminate hallucinations. The generative component may still produce content that extrapolates beyond or misinterprets the retrieved context. This risk becomes particularly concerning when the system confidently presents incorrect information with apparent source attribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, recent research has shed light on critical limitations of key techniques used in RAGs systems. A relevant finding pertains to reranking, which has shown {cite}`jacob2024drowningdocumentsconsequencesscaling`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Diminishing Returns**: Performance degrades as the number of documents (K) increases, sometimes performing worse than basic retrievers when dealing with large datasets.\n",
    "- **Poor Document Discrimination**: Rerankers can be misled by irrelevant documents, sometimes assigning high scores to content with minimal relevance to the query.\n",
    "- **Consistency Issues**: Performance and relative rankings between different rerankers can vary significantly depending on the number of documents being processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Will RAGs exist in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is posed as we contrast RAGs with LLMs with long-context windows (LCs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent research has shed light on this specific point {cite}`li2024retrievalaugmentedgenerationlongcontext` suggesting a trade-off between cost and performance. On the one hand, RAGs can be seen as a cost-effective alternative to LC models:\n",
    "*   RAGs offer lower computational cost compared to LCs due to the significantly shorter input length required for processing.\n",
    "*   This cost-efficiency arises because RAG reduces the number of input tokens to LLMs, which in turn reduces overall usage cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, this RAG benefit is achieved at the cost of performance:\n",
    "*   Recent advancements in LLMs, in particular with Gemini-1.5 and GPT-4o models, demonstrate capabilities in understanding long contexts directly, which enables them to outperform RAG in terms of average performance.\n",
    "*   LC models can process extremely long contexts, such as Gemini 1.5 which can handle up to 1 million tokens, and these models benefit from large-scale pretraining to develop strong long-context capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cost-performance trade-off is illustrated in {numref}`LC`, where LC models outperform RAGs in terms of average performance while RAGs are more cost-effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../_static/input/LC.png\n",
    "---\n",
    "name: LC\n",
    "alt: Long-Context LLMs for Superior Performance\n",
    "scale: 50%\n",
    "align: center\n",
    "---\n",
    "Long-Context LLMs demonstrate superior performance while RAGs are more cost-effective {cite}`li2024retrievalaugmentedgenerationlongcontext`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "{numref}`LC` also shows a model called \"SELF-ROUTE\" which combines RAG and LC by routing queries based on model self-reflection. This is a hybrid approach that reduces computational costs while maintaining performance comparable to LC. The advantage of SELF-ROUTE is most significant for smaller values of *k*, where *k* is the number of retrieved text chunks, and SELF-ROUTE shows a marked improvement in performance over RAG, while as k increases the performance of RAG and SELF-ROUTE approaches that of LC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of a hybrid approach that combines the benefits of both LC and RAGs is RetroLLM {cite}`li2024retrollmempoweringlargelanguage`, which is a unified framework that integrates retrieval and generation into a single process, enabling language models to generate fine-grained evidence directly from a corpus. The key contribution is that this approach delivers those benefits while eliminating the need for a separate retriever, addressing limitations of traditional RAG methods. Experimental results demonstrate RetroLLM's superior performance compared to traditional RAG methods, across both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. It also achieves a significant reduction in token consumption due to its fine-grained evidence retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "CAG {cite}`chan2024dontragcacheaugmentedgeneration` is another solution that eliminates the need for RAGs as it proposes cache-augmented generation (CAG). CAG preloads all relevant data into a large language model's extended context window, eliminating the need for real-time retrieval and improving speed and accuracy. This is achieved by precomputing a key-value cache, further optimizing inference time. CAG demonstrates superior performance compared to RAG by achieving higher BERT scores in most evaluated scenarios, indicating better answer quality, and by having significantly reduced generation times. These results suggest that CAG can be both more accurate and more efficient than traditional RAG systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another relevant development in this area is the introduction of LOFT {cite}`lee2024longcontextlanguagemodelssubsume`, a benchmark to assess this paradigm shift from RAGs to LCs, using real-world tasks requiring context up to millions of tokens. Evidence suggests LCs can deliver performance with simplified pipelines compared to RAGs, particularly for tasking requiring multi-hop reasoning over long contexts when using Chain-of-Thought {cite}`wei2023chainofthoughtpromptingelicitsreasoning`. However, LCs can still be outperformed by specialized retrievers, in particular Gecko, a specialized model fine-tuned on extensive text retrieval and similarity tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bottom-line: Do we really need RAGs? The answer is conditional:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **RAG may be relevant when cost-effectiveness is a key requirement** and where the model needs to access vast amounts of external knowledge without incurring high computational expenses. However, as LLMs context window sizes increase and LLMs cost per input token decreases, RAGs may not be as relevant as it was before.\n",
    "*   **Long-context LLMs are superior when performance is the primary concern**, and the model needs to handle extensive texts that require deep contextual understanding and reasoning.\n",
    "*   **Hybrid approaches like SELF-ROUTE are valuable as they combine the strengths of RAG and LC** offering a practical balance between cost and performance, especially for applications where both factors are critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the choice among RAG, LC, or a hybrid method depends on the specific requirements of the task, available resources, and the acceptable trade-off between cost and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a later case study, we demonstrate the power of LCs as we construct a Quiz generator with citations over a large knowledge base without the use of chunking nor RAGs.\n"

    "### Case Study I: Content Chunking with Contextual Linking\n",
    "\n",
    "Content chunking is commonly used to breakdown long-form content into smaller, manageable chunks. In the context of RAGs, this can be helpful not only to help the retrieval system find more contextually relevant documents but also lead to a more cost efficient LLM solution since fewer tokens are processed in the context window. Furthermore, semantic chunking can increase accuracy of RAG systems {cite}`zenml2024rag`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Content chunking with contextual linking is a chunking technique that seeks to split input content while keeping chunk-specific context, hence allowing the LLM to maintain coherence and context when generating responses per chunks. In that way, this technique tackles two key problems:\n",
    "1. The LLM's inability to process long inputs to do context-size limits\n",
    "2. The LLM's inability to maintain coherence and context when generating responses per chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence, a third problem is also tackled: LLM's inability to generate long-form content due to the `max_output_tokens` limitation. Since we generate responses per chunk, as we will see later, we end up with a solution that is capable of generating long-form content while maintaining coherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "We exemplify this technique by following these steps:\n",
    "1. **Chunking the Content**: The input content is split into smaller chunks. This allows the LLM to process each chunk individually, focusing on generating a complete and detailed response for that specific section of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Maintaining Context**: Each chunk is linked with contextual information from the previous chunks. This helps in maintaining the flow and coherence of the content across multiple chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generating Linked Prompts**: For each chunk, a prompt is generated that includes the chunk's content and its context. This prompt is then used to generate the output for that chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Combining the Outputs**: The outputs of all chunks are combined to form the final long-form content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine an example implementation of this technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generating long-form content\n",

    "Content Chunking with Contextual Linking Schematic Representation.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram in {numref}`content-chunking-with-contextual-linking` illustrates the process we will follow for handling long-form content generation with Large Language Models through \"Content Chunking with Contextual Linking.\" It shows how input content is first split into manageable chunks using a chunking function (e.g. `CharacterTextSplitter` with `tiktoken` tokenizer), then each chunk is processed sequentially while maintaining context from previous chunks. For each chunk, the system updates the context, generates a dynamic prompt with specific parameters, makes a call to the LLM chain, and stores the response. After all chunks are processed, the individual responses are combined with newlines to create the final report, effectively working around the token limit constraints of LLMs while maintaining coherence across the generated content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Chunking the Content**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different methods for chunking, and each of them might be appropriate for different situations. However, we can broadly group chunking strategies in two types:\n",
    "- **Fixed-size Chunking**: This is the most common and straightforward approach to chunking. We simply decide the number of tokens in our chunk and, optionally, whether there should be any overlap between them. In general, we will want to keep some overlap between chunks to make sure that the semantic context doesn’t get lost between chunks. Fixed-sized chunking may be a reasonable path in many common cases. Compared to other forms of chunking, fixed-sized chunking is computationally cheap and simple to use since it doesn’t require the use of any specialied techniques or libraries.\n",
    "- **Content-aware Chunking**: These are a set of methods for taking advantage of the nature of the content we’re chunking and applying more sophisticated chunking to it. Examples include:\n",
    "  - **Sentence Splitting**: Many models are optimized for embedding sentence-level content. Naturally, we would use sentence chunking, and there are several approaches and tools available to do this, including naive splitting (e.g. splitting on periods), NLTK, and spaCy.\n",
    "  - **Recursive Chunking**: Recursive chunking divides the input text into smaller chunks in a hierarchical and iterative manner using a set of separators.\n",
    "  - **Semantic Chunking**: This is a class of methods that leverages embeddings to extract the semantic meaning present in your data, creating chunks that are made up of sentences that talk about the same theme or topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Here, we will utilize `langchain` for a content-aware sentence-splitting strategy for chunking. Langchain offers several text splitters {cite}`langchain_text_splitters` such as JSON-, Markdown- and HTML-based or split by token. We will use the `CharacterTextSplitter` with `tiktoken` as our tokenizer to count the number of tokens per chunk which we can use to ensure that we do not surpass the input token limit of our model.\n"

       "This report provides a comprehensive analysis of Apple Inc.'s financial performance and position for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024, as disclosed in its Form 10-K filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.  The analysis will focus on identifying key risk factors impacting Apple's business, evaluating its financial health, and uncovering market-moving insights derived from the provided data.  The report will delve into Apple's various segments, product lines, and services, examining their performance and contributions to overall financial results.  Specific attention will be paid to identifying trends, potential challenges, and opportunities for future growth.  The analysis will also consider the broader macroeconomic environment and its influence on Apple's operations and financial outlook.  Finally, the report will incorporate relevant information from Apple's definitive proxy statement for its 2025 annual meeting of shareholders, as incorporated by reference in the Form 10-K.\n",
       "\n",
       "**PART 2: Key Risk Factors and Market-Moving Insights**\n",
       "\n",
       "This section analyzes key risk factors disclosed in Apple Inc.'s 2024 Form 10-K, focusing on their potential impact on financial performance and identifying potential market-moving insights.  The analysis is structured around the major risk categories identified in the filing.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2.1 Dependence on Third-Party Developers:**\n",
       "\n",
       "Apple's success is heavily reliant on the continued support and innovation of third-party software developers.  The Form 10-K highlights several critical aspects of this dependence:\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Market Share Vulnerability:** Apple's relatively smaller market share in smartphones, personal computers, and tablets compared to competitors (Android, Windows, gaming consoles) could discourage developers from prioritizing Apple's platform, leading to fewer high-quality apps and potentially impacting customer purchasing decisions.  This is a significant risk, especially given the rapid pace of technological change.  A decline in app availability or quality could negatively impact sales and market share.  **Market-moving insight:**  Monitoring developer activity and app quality across competing platforms is crucial for assessing this risk.  Any significant shift in developer focus away from iOS could be a negative market signal.\n",
       "\n",
       "* **App Store Dynamics:** While Apple allows developers to retain most App Store revenue, its commission structure and recent changes (e.g., complying with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the EU) introduce uncertainty.  Changes to the App Store's policies or fee structures could materially affect Apple's revenue and profitability.  **Market-moving insight:**  Closely monitoring regulatory developments (especially concerning the DMA) and their impact on App Store revenue is essential.  Any significant changes to Apple's App Store policies or revenue streams could trigger market reactions.\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Content Acquisition and Creation:** Apple's reliance on third-party digital content providers for its services introduces risks related to licensing agreements, competition, and pricing.  The cost of producing its own digital content is also increasing due to competition for talent and subscribers.  Failure to secure or create appealing content could negatively impact user engagement and revenue.  **Market-moving insight:**  Analyzing the success of Apple's original content initiatives and the renewal rates of third-party content agreements will provide insights into this risk.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2.2 Operational Risks:**\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       " (...) \n",
       "\n",
       " The reconciliation of segment operating income to consolidated operating income reveals that research and development (R&D) and other corporate expenses significantly impact overall profitability.  While increased R&D is generally positive, it reduces short-term profits.  The geographical breakdown of net sales and long-lived assets further emphasizes the concentration of Apple's business in the U.S. and China.  **Market-moving insight:**  Continued weakness in the Greater China market, sustained flat iPhone sales, or any significant changes in R&D spending should be closely monitored for their potential impact on Apple's financial performance and investor sentiment.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**5.4 Auditor's Report and Internal Controls:**\n",
       "\n",
       "The auditor's report expresses an unqualified opinion on Apple's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting.  However, it identifies uncertain tax positions as a critical audit matter.  The significant amount of unrecognized tax benefits ($22.0 billion) and the complexity involved in evaluating these positions highlight a substantial risk.  Management's assessment of these positions involves significant judgment and relies on interpretations of complex tax laws.  Apple's management also asserts that its disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  **Market-moving insight:**  Any changes in tax laws, unfavorable rulings on uncertain tax positions, or weaknesses in internal controls could materially affect Apple's financial results and investor confidence.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**Conclusion**\n",
       "\n",
       "This report provides a comprehensive analysis of Apple Inc.'s financial performance and position for fiscal year 2024.  While Apple maintains a strong financial position with substantial cash reserves and a robust capital return program, several key risk factors could significantly impact its future performance.  These risks include:\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Dependence on third-party developers:**  A shift in developer focus away from iOS or changes to the App Store's policies could negatively impact Apple's revenue and profitability.\n",
       "* **Operational risks:**  Employee retention challenges, reseller dependence, and cybersecurity threats pose significant operational risks.\n",
       "* **Legal and regulatory risks:**  Ongoing antitrust litigation, the Digital Markets Act (DMA) compliance, and data privacy regulations introduce substantial legal and regulatory uncertainties.\n",
       "* **Financial risks:**  Volatility in sales and profit margins, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, credit risk, and tax risks could impact Apple's financial performance.\n",
       "* **Supply chain concentration:**  Apple's reliance on a concentrated network of outsourcing partners, primarily located in a few Asian countries, and dependence on single or limited sources for certain custom components, exposes the company to significant supply chain risks.\n",
       "* **Uncertain tax positions:**  The significant amount of unrecognized tax benefits represents a substantial uncertainty that could materially affect Apple's financial results.\n",
       "\n",
       "Despite these risks, Apple's strong liquidity position, continued growth in its Services segment, and robust capital return program provide a degree of resilience.  However, investors and analysts should closely monitor the market-moving insights identified throughout this report, including developer activity, regulatory developments, regional economic conditions, supply chain stability, and the resolution of uncertain tax positions, to assess their potential impact on Apple's future performance and valuation.  The significant short-term obligations, while manageable given Apple's cash position, highlight the need for continued financial discipline and effective risk management.  A deeper, more granular analysis of the financial statements and notes is recommended for a more complete assessment."

    "#### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Results from the generated report present a few interesting aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Coherence**: The generated report demonstrates an apparent level of coherence. The sections are logically structured, and the flow of information is smooth. Each part of the report builds upon the previous sections, providing a comprehensive analysis of Apple Inc.'s financial performance and key risk factors. The use of headings and subheadings helps in maintaining clarity and organization throughout the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adherence to Instructions**: The LLM followed the provided instructions effectively. The report is in a readable, structured format, and it focuses on identifying risk factors and market-moving insights as requested. The analysis is detailed and covers various aspects of Apple's financial performance, including revenue segmentation, profitability, liquidity, and capital resources. The inclusion of market-moving insights adds value to the report, aligning with the specified requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the seemingly good quality of the results, there are some limitations to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Depth of Analysis**: While the report covers a wide range of topics, the depth of analysis in certain sections may not be as comprehensive as a human expert's evaluation. Some nuances and contextual factors might be overlooked by the LLM. Splitting the report into multiple parts helps in mitigating this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chunking Strategy**: The current approach splits the text into chunks based on size, which ensures that each chunk fits within the model's token limit. However, this method may disrupt the logical flow of the document, as sections of interest might be split across multiple chunks. An alternative approach could be \"structured\" chunking, where the text is divided based on meaningful sections or topics. This would preserve the coherence of each section, making it easier to follow and understand. Implementing structured chunking requires additional preprocessing to identify and segment the text appropriately, but it can significantly enhance the readability and logical flow of the generated report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we implemented a simple strategy to improve the coherence in output generation given a multi-part chunked input. Many other strategies are possible. One related technique worth mentioning is Anthropic's Contextual Retrieval {cite}`anthropic2024contextualretrieval`. The approach, as shown in {numref}`anth_contextual`, employs an LLM itself to generate relevant context per chunk before passing these two pieces of information together to the LLM. This process was proposed in the context of RAGs to enhance its retrieval capabilities but can be applied more generally to improve output generation.\n",

    "- Initialization:\n",
    "    - `__init__(knowledge_base: List[str] = [])`: Initialize with optional list of URLs as knowledge base\n",

    "    - `add_knowledge_base(urls: List[str]) -> None`: Add URLs to the knowledge base\n",
    "    - `add(urls: List[str]) -> None`: Extract content from URLs and add to conversation input\n",
    "    - `msg(msg: str = \"\", add_citations: bool = False) -> str`: Enables users to send messages to the client\n",
    "    - `quiz(add_citations: bool = True, num_questions: int = 10) -> str`: Generate a quiz based on full input memory\n",

    "    - `response_memory`: Cumulative responses (long-term memory)\n",
    "    - `urls_memory`: Cumulative list of processed URLs\n",

    "#### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment demonstrated the ability to build a knowledge base from multiple sources while leveraging prompt caching for efficiency and generate quizzes with citations for verifiability. The system successfully ingested content from Project Gutenberg texts, including historical documents like the Magna Carta, and used them to create interactive educational content.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, several limitations emerged during this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Memory Management: The system currently loads all content into memory, which could become problematic with larger knowledge bases. A more scalable approach might involve chunking or streaming the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Citation Quality: While the system provides citations, they lack specificity - pointing to entire documents rather than specific passages or page numbers. This limits the ability to fact-check or verify specific claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Content Verification: While citations are provided, the system is not guaranteed to provide factual information. This could lead to potential hallucinations or misinterpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "While limitations are present in this simple example, the case study highlights that not always complex systems are needed. Alternative simple strategies should be preferred when possible, particularly if capable, long-context window models are available and fit within the application requirements.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter has explored critical strategies and techniques for managing input data in LLM applications, focusing on three key areas: data parsing, retrieval augmentation, and practical implementation patterns. We examined how parsing tools like MarkItDown and Docling can transform diverse data formats into LLM-compatible representations, demonstrating through case studies how parser quality can impact LLM performance. The chapter also investigated retrieval augmentation techniques, particularly RAG systems, showing how they can enhance LLM capabilities by providing access to external knowledge while discussing their future relevance in the context of emerging long-context language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through our case studies, we demonstrated practical approaches to handling common challenges in LLM applications. The Content Chunking with Contextual Linking case study illustrated techniques for managing long-form content generation while maintaining coherence across chunks. The Quiz Generation with Citations case study showcased how long-context windows can be effectively utilized without the need for complex retrieval systems, highlighting the importance of choosing the right approach based on specific application requirements rather than defaulting to more complex solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the field continues to evolve, the choice between traditional RAG systems and emerging long-context models will likely become increasingly nuanced. While RAGs offer cost-effective solutions for incorporating external knowledge, the rise of long-context models suggests a future where simpler architectures might suffice for many applications. The key insight is that effective input data management requires careful consideration of trade-offs among complexity, cost, and performance, always guided by specific application requirements rather than following a one-size-fits-all approach. Success in building robust LLM applications will depend on understanding these trade-offs and selecting appropriate strategies for each use case."
