    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Running Open Source LLMs locally versus depending on proprietary cloud-based models represents more than just a technical choice - it's a fundamental re-imagining of how we interact with AI technology, putting control back in the hands of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy concerns are a key driver for running LLMs locally. Individual users may want to process personal documents, photos, emails, and chat messages without sharing sensitive data with third parties. For enterprise use cases, organizations handling medical records must comply with HIPAA regulations that require data to remain on-premise. Similarly, businesses processing confidential documents and intellectual property, as well as organizations subject to GDPR and other privacy regulations, need to maintain strict control over their data processing pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost considerations are another key driver. Organizations and individual consumers can better control expenses by matching model capabilities to their specific needs rather than paying for multiple cloud API subscriptions. For organizations with high-volume applications, this customization and control over costs becomes especially valuable compared to the often prohibitive per-request pricing of cloud solutions. For consumers, running multiple open source models locally eliminates the need to maintain separate subscriptions to access different model capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications with stringent latency requirements form another important category. Real-time systems where network delays would be unacceptable, edge computing scenarios demanding quick responses, and interactive applications requiring sub-second performance all benefit from local deployment. This extends to embedded systems in IoT devices where cloud connectivity might be unreliable or impractical. Further, the emergence of Small Language Models (SLMs) has made edge deployment increasingly viable, enabling sophisticated language capabilities on resource-constrained devices like smartphones, tablets and IoT sensors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Running open source models locally also enables fine-grained optimization of resource usage and model characteristics based on target use case. Organizations and researchers can perform specialized domain adaptation through model modifications, experiment with different architectures and parameters, and integrate models with proprietary systems and workflows. This flexibility is particularly valuable for developing novel applications that require direct model access and manipulation. \n",
    " \n",
    "However, local deployment introduces its own set of challenges and considerations. In this Chapter, we explore the landscape of local LLM deployment focused on Open Source models and tools. When choosing a local open source model, organizations must carefully evaluate several interconnected factors, from task suitability and performance requirements to resource constraints and licensing.\n",
    " \n",
    "We also cover key tools enabling local model serving and inference, including open source solutions such as LLama.cpp, Llamafile, and Ollama, along with user-friendly frontend interfaces that make local LLM usage more accessible. We conclude with a detailed case study, analyzing how different quantization approaches impact model performance in resource-constrained environments. This analysis reveals the critical tradeoffs between model size, inference speed, and output quality that practitioners must navigate."

    "## Models Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The landscape of open source LLMs is rapidly evolving, with new models emerging by the day. While proprietary LLMs have garnered significant attention, open source LLMs are gaining traction due to their flexibility, customization options, and cost-effectiveness. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to observe long-term strategic considerations when choosing a model. These entails prioritization dimensions that may enable competitive advantage in the long-term, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Managed Services Support**: You may start experimenting locally with LLMs but eventually you will need to deployment options: either host models yourself or consider managed services. Cloud providers like AWS Bedrock, SambaNova and Together.ai can simplify deployment and management but model family support varies along with varying SLAs for model availability, support and model serving {cite}`artificialanalysis2024llmproviders`. One should evaluate the availability of managed services for your target model family. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Vendor Long-Term Viability**: Consider vendor's long-term strategy and transparency around future development. Evaluate factors like funding, market position, and development velocity to assess whether the vendor will remain a reliable partner. Further, transparency around long-term strategy and roadmap is a critical consideration when choosing a model vendor partner.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Single-Provider Lock-in**: Users and organizations should avoid the risk of lock-in by remaining flexible with your choice of LLM providers. Today's winning models are not guaranteed to be the same in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Time-to-market and Customization**: As the same models are available to everyone, base capabilities are becoming commoditized. As a consequence, competitive advantage comes from the application layer. Hence, the ability to iterate fast while customizing to your specific domain becomes a critical strategic consideration when choosing a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Competitive Edge**: As the cost of (pre-trained) general intelligence decays rapidly, proprietary data becomes competitive advantage. Hence, the ability to add unique, custom, domain-specific datasets to base models is a critical consideration that will separate winners from losers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we aim to provide a comprehensive set of considerations to selecting the right open-source LLM for your specific needs, emphasizing the importance of aligning the LLM's capabilities with the intended task and considering resources constraints."

    "\n",
    "When evaluating an open source LLM, task suitability is a critical first consideration. A model that performs well on general benchmarks may struggle with specific domain tasks. Understanding the intended use case helps narrow down model options based on their demonstrated strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task Categories**\n",
    "\n",
    "When determining which LLM task to prioritize, carefully consider your specific use case and end-user needs. Different applications require distinct model capabilities and optimizations. Common LLM Task Categories include:\n",
    "- **Text Summarization**: Condensing documents into concise summaries that capture key information.\n",
    "- **Question Answering**: Providing accurate responses by extracting relevant information from knowledge bases.\n",
    "- **Text Generation**: Creating high-quality content across formats, from documentation to creative writing.\n",
    "- **Code Generation**: Writing clean, documented code in multiple programming languages.\n",
    "- **Language Translation**: Converting text between languages while preserving meaning and nuance.\n",
    "- **Dialogue Systems**: Enabling natural conversations for customer support and interactive learning.\n",
    "- **Text Classification**: Categorizing and labeling text data for sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and content moderation.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Base Models**: These foundation models provide broad language understanding capabilities but typically require additional fine-tuning to excel at specific tasks. They serve as versatile starting points for customization. Examples: meta-llama/Llama-2-70b, Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instruction-Tuned Models**: Enhanced through fine-tuning on instruction-following datasets, these models excel at interpreting and executing explicit prompts and commands. They bridge the gap between general language capabilities and practical task execution. Chat models are a good example of this category. Examples: meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf (Chat), Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Domain-Adapted Models**: Specialized for particular fields through targeted fine-tuning and/or preference-alignment on domain-specific data. Examples: Med-PaLM 2 for healthcare, BloombergGPT for finance.\n",

    "The Llama 2 model family {cite}`touvron2023llama2openfoundation` illustrates these distinctions well. The base Llama 2, trained on 2 trillion tokens of public data, demonstrates general-purpose capabilities across text generation and translation tasks. Its chat-optimized instruction-tuned variant, Llama 2-Chat, underwent additional fine-tuning on over 1 million human-annotated conversational examples, making it particularly adept at natural dialogue.\n",
    "\n",

Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct {cite}`hui2024qwen2` is an example of a purpose-built model that demonstrates significant performance on the specific task of code generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "Model features can either enable or limit the feasibility of specific use cases. Understanding features of your candidate models is crucial for determining whether a model is suitable for your application. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context Length**: The model's ability to process longer text sequences directly impacts task suitability. A legal contract analysis systems requiring the model to reason about a 5000-page document would be impractical with a model limited to 2,048 tokens, while models supporting 2M tokens could handle this task effectively without the need for other techniques e.g. context chunking.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output Control**: Some tasks require precise, factual and structured outputs while others allow more creative, unstructured generation. Models vary in their output reliability. Grammar constraints and other control mechanisms may be needed to ensure reliable outputs. See Chapter {ref}`structure` for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Caching**: Models that support caching can speed up inference at lower costs. This becomes particularly important for applications requiring cost-effective real-time responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-modal Capabilities**: Some applications fundamentally require multi-modal processing. A medical diagnosis assistant analyzing both patient records and X-ray images would be impossible to implement with a text-only model, necessitating a multi-modal model that can process both text and images coherently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output Token Length**: The model's capacity to generate longer responses affects its suitability for content generation tasks. A model excelling at concise responses may struggle with long-form content creation like technical documentation or detailed analysis reports. See Chapter {ref}`output_size` for more details.\n"

    "While standard benchmarks provide valuable initial insights, they should be interpreted cautiously since models can be specifically optimized for these popular tests without necessarily performing well in target use cases. This necessitates developing custom evaluation frameworks with real-world validation - creating test datasets representing actual usage scenarios, defining metrics aligned with business objectives, and establishing clear baselines and improvement targets. Only through such rigorous testing can practitioners truly understand how well a model will perform in their specific context.\n",

    "- **Time-Related**:\n",
    "  - **Time Per Output Token (TPOT)**: This metric measures the speed of text generation and is crucial for user experience, especially in interactive applications.\n",
    "  - **Time to First Token (TTFT)**: Essential for streaming applications like chatbots, as it measures how quickly the model begins generating a response.\n",
    "  - **Latency**: Time to first token of tokens received, in seconds, after API request sent. For models which do not support streaming, this represents time to receive the completion.\n",

While permissive licenses like Apache 2.0 and MIT allow broad usage rights, custom licenses may impose specific restrictions on commercial applications or model derivatives, making thorough license review essential for sustainable implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training data sources for LLMs represent another critical consideration. Models vary significantly in their training data foundations - some leverage purely public datasets while others incorporate proprietary or restricted content with the added complexity that public data does not mean free data. These data choices fundamentally impact not only model capabilities but also legal and regulatory compliance.\n",

    "The legal landscape surrounding LLM training data has grown increasingly complex, particularly regarding copyright infringement concerns. The high-profile lawsuit between OpenAI and The New York Times {cite}`harvardlawreview2024nyt` serves as a pivotal example, where the Times claims its copyrighted materials were used without authorization to train language models. This litigation has far-reaching consequences for developers building LLM-powered applications. Should courts rule in favor of copyright holders, model providers may need to withdraw and retrain models containing protected content. These legal uncertainties introduce substantial complexity into LLM implementation strategies, demanding careful consideration during project planning phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent LLM releases demonstrate varying levels of data transparency. For instance, Qwen2.5's approach {cite}`qwen2024qwen25technicalreport` illustrates common industry practices in both its achievements and limitations. On the training data scale front, Qwen2.5 does provide some transparency by discussing some training data methodology compared to previous versions such as expanding from 7 trillion to 18 trillion tokens, while implementing sophisticated quality filtering and carefully balancing domain representation through sampling adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, like many commercial LLMs, Qwen2.5 exhibits transparency limitations. The report provides incomplete disclosure of data sources and limited information about the proportions of different data types used in training. The preprocessing methodologies remain unclear, and there is minimal discussion of potential biases that may exist in the training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in the Llama 3 paper {cite}`grattafiori2024llama3herdmodels`, Meta AI does share some details about the pre-training corpus stating simply stating that it was around 15T multilingual tokens, compared to 1.8T tokens for Llama 2. The exact sources of data used for pre-training and post-training are not explicitly listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "These gaps in transparency reflect a broader industry challenge in balancing commercial interests with the need for openness and scientific reproducibility.\n",

    "A significant advancement in open-source language model training data is HuggingFace's release of the FineWeb datasets. In its first release {cite}`penedo2024finewebdatasetsdecantingweb`, FineWeb is made of a 15-trillion token dataset derived from 96 Common Crawl snapshots that produces better-performing LLMs than other open pretraining datasets. Additionally, data curation codebase and all of the models trained during our ablation experiments are made available.

    "#### Ollama\n",
    "\n",
    "Ollama is a lightweight, MIT-licensed open-source tool for running LLMs locally. It provides a simple interface for interacting with a wide range of language models, including popular models like Llama 3.1 and Llama 3.2. Ollama is designed to be easy to install and use, making it a popular choice for developers who want to run LLMs locally without the need for extensive setup or configuration. Ollama's key advantages include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Management**\n",

    "- Q4_K quantization (balanced compression/precision)\n",
    "- Q6_K quantization (lowest compression, highest precision)\n",

    "\n",
    "Recall that for a sequence of N tokens, perplexity is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{PPL(B, X)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\log_2 P(x_i|x_{<i})\\right) $$\n",

    "- $N$ is the total number of tokens in the sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate quantization quality, we first calculate perplexity scores for both the base model and quantized variants. We then compute the ratio of quantized to base perplexity and average it across all prompt samples as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Avg PPL Ratio = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{\\text{PPL}_i(Q)}{\\text{PPL}_i(\\text{base})} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These are two simple metrics to evaluate how much worse the quantized model performs on an intrinsic basis which we then can compare to the base model's perplexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguably, KL Divergence is a better metric enabling direct comparison of relative performance instead of intrinsic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**KL Divergence**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence (or Cross-Entropy) measures how one probability distribution differs from another reference distribution. For comparing logits between a base model (B) and quantized model (Q), we can calculate the KL divergence as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ D_{KL}(P||Q) = \\sum_{i} P(i) \\log \\frac{P(i)}{Q(i)} $$\n",

    "### Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantization analysis of the Qwen 2.5 0.5B model demonstrates a clear trade-off among model size, inference speed, and prediction quality. While the base model (1170 MiB) maintains the highest accuracy it operates at the lowest text generation and prompt throughput of 19.73 tokens/s and 94.39 tokens/s, respectively. In contrast, the Q2_K quantization achieves significant size reduction (67%) and the highest throughput (42.62 tokens/s), but exhibits the largest quality degradation with a 10.36% perplexity increase and lowest KL divergence among quantized models. Q4_K emerges as a compelling middle ground, offering substantial size reduction (60%) and strong text generation and prompt throughput performance (38.38 tokens/s and 77.08 tokens/s, respectively), while maintaining good model quality with only 3.5% perplexity degradation and middle-ground KL divergence level. \n",
    "\n",
    "These results, achieved on commodity CPU hardware, demonstrate that quantization can significantly improve inference speed and reduce model size while maintaining acceptable quality thresholds, making large language models more accessible for resource-constrained environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that these results are not meant to be exhaustive and are only meant to provide a general idea of the trade-offs involved in quantization. Targeted benchmarks should be performed for specific use cases and models to best reflect real-world performance."

    "Running open source language models locally represents a compelling proposition in how we interact with AI technology. The transition from cloud-based to local deployment offers important advantages in terms of privacy, cost control, and customization flexibility, while introducing important technical considerations around resource management and performance optimization. The growing ecosystem of tools and frameworks, from low-level libraries like llama.cpp to user-friendly interfaces like LM Studio and Jan, has made local deployment increasingly accessible to both individual developers and organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our case study demonstrated that quantization can significantly improve inference speed and reduce model size while maintaining acceptable quality thresholds, making large language models more accessible for resource-constrained environments. As demonstrated in our case study with the Qwen 2.5 0.5B model, practitioners can achieve significant reductions in model size and improvements in inference speed while maintaining acceptable performance levels. The Q4_K quantization scheme emerged as a particularly effective compromise, offering substantial size reduction (60%) and strong throughput while limiting quality degradation to just 3.5% in perplexity measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking ahead, the continued development of open source models and deployment tools suggests a future where local AI deployment becomes increasingly viable and sophisticated. The success of open source models like Qwen and Llama, combined with improvements in local model serving and techniques couple with efficient small language models (SLMs), indicate that local deployment will likely play an increasingly important role in the AI landscape. However, practitioners must carefully evaluate their specific requirements across dimensions like task suitability, resource constraints, and performance needs when choosing between local and cloud-based deployment strategies.\n",
