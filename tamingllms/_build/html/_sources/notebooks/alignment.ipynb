    "\n",
    "Large Language Models have revolutionized the way we interact with technology, showcasing an impressive ability to generate human-like text, translate languages, and answer questions with remarkable accuracy. However, ensuring these powerful models behave in a safe and aligned manner with human values remains a critical challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining the LLM Alignment Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM alignment involves guiding LLMs to produce outputs that are not only factually accurate but also consistent with human values, goals, and ethical standards. This means ensuring the model's responses are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Helpful:** Providing useful and relevant information while adhering to user instructions.  \n",
    "* **Honest:** Generating truthful and transparent responses, avoiding fabrication or misleading information.  \n",
    "* **Harmless:** Refraining from generating outputs that could be harmful, unethical, or offensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Achieving alignment is a complex endeavor due to the inherent challenges in defining and quantifying human values, the potential for adversarial inputs to manipulate the model, and the intricate nature of LLMs themselves. Furthermore, researchers have demonstrated the severity of misalignment by employing various \"jailbreak\" techniques that can induce LLMs to produce malicious content during conversations. This highlights the critical need for effective alignment strategies to mitigate potential risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to recognize that LLM alignment is an ongoing process, not a one-time solution Human values and goals are constantly evolving, and alignment techniques must adapt to these changes. Moreover, alignment is subjective, involving judgment calls about which values take precedence. This necessitates ongoing research, development, and ethical considerations to ensure LLMs remain aligned with human values in a dynamic world.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) \n",
    "\n",
    "DPO is a fine-tuning technique that allows us to align language models with human preferences. The key idea is to train the model to prefer responses that align with our desired behavior over responses that do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "DPO works by:\n",
    " 1. Taking pairs of responses (chosen and rejected) for the same prompt\n",
    " 2. Training the model to assign higher probability to the chosen response\n",
    " 3. Minimizing the KL divergence between the original and fine-tuned model to preserve general capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    " The main advantages of DPO over other alignment techniques are:\n",

    "## Case Study: Aligning a Language Model to a Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study, we will align a language model to a policy. The policy is a set of principles and rules that we want the language model to adhere to. All methodology and code available solves this general problem of policy-based alignment. However, we will describe a specific case study to illustrate our approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that we are working for Acme Inc., a company dedicated to democratizing access to computer science education for K-12 students. Acme Inc. is in the process of creating a chatbot named `smolK-12`, a small open source LLM, specifically designed for K-12 students.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study, we'll explore how to align a language model with Acme Inc.'s policy to ensure its LLM-powered applications are safe and appropriate for K-12 students.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll walk through the process of:\n",
    "1. Creating a synthetic dataset of policy-aligned preferences\n",
    "2. Fine-tuning a base model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)\n",
    "3. Evaluating the aligned model against the base model and measuring alignment with Acme Inc.'s educational policies\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "#### Experimental Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the following base model: `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-360M-Instruct` {cite}`smollm2024model`, a compact open source language model that is part of the SmolLM2 family published by HuggingFace.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the following APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* HuggingFace Transformers for local model inference\n",
    "* HuggingFace Inference API for remote model inference\n",
    "* HuggingFace datasets for loading/storing our preference aligned dataset\n",
    "* HuggingFace TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning) for fine-tuning the base model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, we will use some general utility functions available in the `tamingllms` [library](https://github.com/souzatharsis/tamingLLMs/blob/master/tamingllms/notebooks/taming_utils.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, since we will use OpenAI's API, we will need create a `.env` file in the root of the repository with the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, we will have:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `smolK-12`, a fine-tuned model aligned with Acme Inc.'s policy \n",
    "* A DPO-based reusable dataset capturing policy preferences\n",
    "* Evaluation metrics to measure alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Note on smolLM2 Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have decided to anchor our Case Study on HuggingFace's SmolLM2 models {cite}`smollm2024`, it is worth providing a reason for this choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "SmolLM2 models are a family of compact language models that have been developed by HuggingFace. They are designed to be lightweight and efficient, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, including on-device deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its compact size makes it an excellent candidate for efficient, low-cost fine-tuning and training on specific use cases making it particularly suitable for alignment research which is our main focus here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having said that, it is important to note that reasoning capabilities of SmolLM2 models are not necessarily on par with state-of-the-art LLMs due to its compact size. As we go through this Case Study, it is important to keep this in mind along with several potential issues and limitations, including:\n",
    "- Potential factual inaccuracies\n",
    "- Possible logical inconsistencies\n",
    "- Training data biases\n",
    "- Potential for hallucinations\n",
    "- Potential lack of safety guardrails\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to fine-tune a base model to create an aligned model, we need to construct a dataset of policy-aligned preferences. This dataset will be used to align our base model to our policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a dataset of policy-aligned preferences, we aim to create a dataset of user prompts, rejected responses, and chosen responses. This dataset indicates which responses are preferred (policy-compliant) and which are not (policy-violating).\n",
    "\n",
    "Collecting human-generated high-quality preference data is a resource-intensive and creativity-demanding process, especially for the continual improvement of LLMs {cite}`dong2024selfboostinglargelanguagemodels`. There has been active research to replace or augment human feedback with AI feedback (RLAIF) to tackle these issues {cite}`bai2022constitutionalaiharmlessnessai` giving rise to the field of Synthetic Data Generation {cite}`long2024llmsdrivensyntheticdatageneration`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The application of LLMs for generating synthetic data has shown promise across diverse domains and use cases {cite}`kim2024evaluatinglanguagemodelssynthetic`, including in the context of alignment with human preferences {cite}`dong2024selfboostinglargelanguagemodels`. Recently, Meta AI {cite}`wu2024metarewardinglanguagemodelsselfimproving` introduced a \"self-improving alignment\" scheme where a language model generates responses and evaluates them to create preference pairs further used to run preference optimization to improve model capabilities. Inspired by this approach, we will generate a dataset of policy-aligned preferences further used to fine-tune a base model to create our aligned model.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we define a data schema for our dataset. Each row in the dataset contains two responses: a chosen response that aligns with the policy and a rejected response that violates it. Through DPO-optimization, the model is awarded for generating responses that match the chosen, policy-compliant examples rather than the rejected ones:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Base LLM**: Our unaligned base model that we aim to fine-tune. Its responses to the generated prompts will serve as the \"rejected\" responses in our dataset, as they may not fully align with our policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **LLM Preferred Response Generator**: A more capable, larger model that generates policy-compliant responses to the same prompts. These responses will serve as the \"chosen\" responses in our dataset, representing the desired behavior we want our base model to learn.\n",

    "1. **Learning Rate and Schedule**\n",

    "- Learning rates must be tuned empirically, typically testing values between 1e-7 and 1e-3 {cite}`huyen2024aiengineering`.\n",
    "- A cosine learning rate schedule (`lr_scheduler_type: \"cosine\"`) helps stabilize training by gradually decreasing the learning rate.\n",

    "- Due to the paired nature of DPO training data (preferred vs rejected responses), batch sizes need to be carefully chosen. \n",
    "- Larger batch sizes e.g. 8-16 (`per_device_train_batch_size`) provide more stable training but require more memory. \n",
    "- Gradient accumulation helps work around memory constraints by simulating larger batch sizes (`gradient_accumulation_steps`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Beta Parameter**\n",
    "- The beta parameter controls how strongly the model is pushed toward preferred behaviors. \n",
    "- Lower values (0.1-0.2) make the model more conservative in following preferences, while higher values (0.5+) lead to more aggressive preference learning but risk overfitting.\n",

    "4. **Training Steps and Warmup**\n",
    "- The number of training steps (`max_steps`) depends on dataset size, but 100-1000 steps often suffices for DPO. \n",

The base model readily provides detailed instructions for constructing an explosive device, including specific materials and steps - a clear violation of safety policies and potentially illegal content. In contrast, the aligned model appropriately refuses the request while explaining why such information cannot be provided, citing safety concerns, legal implications, and regulatory frameworks. This initial test suggests that the DPO fine-tuning has successfully improved the model's alignment with safety standards and educational policies. However, this is anecdotal evidence and a more systematic evaluation is needed to quantify this improvement, which we cover in the next section."

    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are complex systems and alignment is a challenging problem. In this case study, we demonstrated how to use DPO to align a language model to a policy further automating the process via synthetic data generation and LLM-as-judge evaluation. Our approach does serve as a proof of concept, however, several considerations should be taken into account when using this methodology in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Synthetic Data Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs can self improve through synthetic data generation {cite}`huang2022largelanguagemodelsselfimprove`. This process helps the LLM learn from its own reasoning and improve its overall reasoning ability without relying on human-annotated data. While LLMs can be powerful tools for generating synthetic data, especially in data-scarce domains, it's important to recognize the potential pitfalls. \n",
    "\n",
    "One major challenge is data distribution bias, where the synthetic data might not accurately mirror the complexities and nuances of real-world data. This can lead to models trained on this data making inaccurate predictions or exhibiting biases. In our case study, we did observe duplicate responses in the synthetic data. Further, the methodology lacks a systematic approach to evaluate the quality of the synthetic data itself only focusing on evals for the consecutive fine-tuned model. This highlights the importance of carefully considering the training data and potential biases of LLMs used for synthetic data generation to mitigate the risk of creating biased or unrepresentative datasets {cite}`hao2024syntheticdataaichallenges`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach does enable a systematic approach to aligning a model to an input policy. However, according to {cite}`Yin2024SelfAugmentedPO`, directly sampling preference pairs, which closely resembles an on-policy setting, can result in performance declines due to inherent volatility and inefficiency. Therefore, constructing effective preference data to continuously improve LLMs remains a critical research problem.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Choice of Base Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of base model is a critical consideration when implementing alignment techniques. In this case study, we selected the smolLM model family due to its efficient architecture and reasonable performance on basic tasks while maintaining relatively low computational requirements. However, the model does have limitations in terms of reasoning capabilities and complex task handling that should be carefully considered {cite}`smollm2024`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world applications need to carefully evaluate the trade-offs between model size/capabilities, and costs. While smaller models like smolLM can be cost-effective for basic alignment experiments, they may not provide the sophisticated reasoning needed for production use cases. The computational and financial costs of training and deploying larger models must be weighed against the required capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For production applications requiring more advanced capabilities, alternative open source models such as those from the LLaMA-3+ {cite}`meta-llama2024` and Qwen {cite}`qwen2024` families have demonstrated remarkable performance that rivals state-of-the-art proprietary models. These models offer enhanced reasoning abilities and better handling of complex tasks, though at increased computational and financial cost. The choice ultimately depends on specific use case requirements, available resources, and acceptable performance thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation Methodology**\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM-as-judge evaluation methodology is a powerful tool for assessing model alignment. However, it does have limitations {cite}`chen2024humansllmsjudgestudy`. For instance, the judge model may not always be able to accurately evaluate the alignment of the model, especially if the judge model is not aligned with the policy itself. Further, the judge model may be biased towards the policy, leading to overly conservative evaluations. In our case study, we do highlight the fact that our judge was simply focused on the policy-alignment aspect of the responses completely neglecting the quality of the responses themselves, i.e. while our fine-tuned model may be more aligned with the policy than the base model, we actually have no evidence that our model is helpful at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more robust evaluation approach would combine LLM-based evaluation with human domain experts in a complementary process. The LLM judge could perform initial high-throughput screening of model responses, flagging potential issues and providing preliminary assessments. These results would then be reviewed by human evaluators with relevant domain expertise who can provide nuanced judgment, catch edge cases, and validate the LLM's evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**DPO Dataset Composition**\n",
    "\n",
    "The composition of the DPO dataset also plays a crucial role in model behavior. In preliminary experiments, using only policy-aligned preference data led to an overly apologetic model that was hesitant to provide helpful responses even for benign queries, i.e. the model was overfitting to the policy. In fact, a model that simply refused to provide an useful response and instead apologized would indeed be aligned with the policy and therefore rewarded accordingly. This led to our decision to construct a more well balanced dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blending our policy-focused dataset with the more general-purpose UltraFeedback dataset from Hugging Face H4 {cite}`ultrafeedback2024` dramatically improved results by helping the model maintain helpfulness while learning appropriate safety boundaries. The results reported here reflect this balanced dataset approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "The construction of the DPO dataset is perhaps the most critical component of the alignment process. While automated approaches can help scale dataset creation, the involvement of domain experts in dataset construction is highly recommended. Domain experts bring invaluable knowledge about edge cases, nuanced policy interpretations, and real-world usage patterns that may not be captured by synthetic data generation alone. Organizations implementing alignment techniques should consider investing in domain expert involvement during dataset construction as a key success factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fine-tuning Process**\n",
    " \n",
    "The effectiveness of DPO training can be highly sensitive to various fine-tuning hyperparameters. As we mentioned before, the batch size and the beta parameter are two key parameters that can significantly impact training stability and model behavior. A careful parameter tuning is required to achieve optimal results, which lacked in our case study.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important limitation of our current implementation is that we did not carefully split our user prompts between in-sample data for fine-tuning and out-of-sample data for evaluation. This means our evaluation metrics may be overly optimistic as the fine-tuned model could be memorizing prompts rather than learning generalizable alignment. Future work should implement proper train/test splits to better assess generalization performance while making sure out/in-sample distributions are similar and representative of real-world data."
