    "The release of ChatGPT 3.5 in late 2022 marked a significant moment in the history of artificial intelligence. Within just five days of its launch, the model attracted over a million users, and within two months, it became the fastest-growing consumer application in history with over 100 million monthly active users.\n",

    "Yet, this raises an intriguing question: Why did ChatGPT 3.5 observe such a dramatic traction when its predecessor, GPT-3, which had the same size/number of parameters, received far less attention from the general public? Arguably, the answer lies not in raw capabilities, but in Preference Alignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through careful fine-tuning using human feedback, OpenAI transformed GPT-3's raw intelligence into ChatGPT's helpful and resourceful conversational abilities. This breakthrough demonstrated that aligning language models with human preferences is just as crucial as scaling them to greater sizes.\n",

    "In this chapter, we will explore the process of aligning language models with human preferences via fine-tuning using modern techniques such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) {cite}`rafailov2024directpreferenceoptimizationlanguage`. Next, we will present a practical case study where we align a language model to a user-provided policy in a fully automated fashion leading to an open source model as well as a dataset of policy-aligned preferences."

    "\n",
    "SFT is a foundational technique for aligning language models with human preferences. Before exploring advanced alignment methods like RLHF, it's useful to understand how SFT can be used to create a strong foundation for instruction following and desired behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high-level, SFT involves fine-tuning language models using carefully curated demonstrations of desired behavior. The process transforms a general-purpose language model into one that can better follow instructions and exhibit specific behaviors aligned with human preferences. Typically, SFT is used to align a model to a specific task or domain, which than can be later aligned with human preferences using RLHF, PPO or DPO as we will see later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision to employ SFT depends on the gap between a model's current capabilities and specific requirements. SFT proves particularly valuable in scenarios requiring:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Precise control over model outputs (e.g. specific format, style, tone)\n",
    "- Domain-specific expertise (medical, legal, technical fields)\n",
    "- Consistent adherence to guidelines (customer service, professional standards)\n",
    "\n",
    "Several approaches exist for implementing SFT, each with distinct advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Full Fine-Tuning**\n",
    "   - Updates all model weights\n",
    "   - Provides maximum control\n",
    "   - Requires significant computational resources\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** {cite}`hu2021loralowrankadaptationlarge`\n",
    "   - Uses two small matrices instead of updating all weights\n",
    "   - Maintains model performance while reducing computational costs\n",
    "   - Enables efficient training on consumer hardware\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **QLoRA (Quantized LoRA)** {cite}`dettmers2023qloraefficientfinetuningquantized`\n",

    "SFT can be seen as a form of behavior cloning of humans. Recently, there has been research on using RLHF or DPO {cite}`rafailov2024directpreferenceoptimizationlanguage` to maximize human preference rather than clone their behavior, which has been shown to be more effective than SFT alone {cite}`ouyang2022traininglanguagemodelsfollow`, which we will explore next."

    "\n",
    "The OpenAI paper {cite}`ouyang2022traininglanguagemodelsfollow` demonstrated the effectiveness of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), particularly using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), for aligning language models with human preferences. PPO {cite}`schulman2017proximalpolicyoptimizationalgorithms` is a widely used reinforcement learning algorithm that has gained popularity particularly since the release of ChatGPT 3.5. It operates by iteratively updating the policy of an LLM, which can be understood as a set of rules that govern how the model generates text. In the context of RLHF, the policy is updated based on rewards that reflect human preferences. For instance, if a human evaluator prefers one LLM output over another, the policy is adjusted to increase the likelihood of generating outputs similar to the preferred one.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key strengths of PPO lies in its ability to handle complex reward landscapes {cite}`huggingface2024rlhf`. In many real-world scenarios, the rewards that an LLM receives may be noisy or delayed. For example, in a chatbot application, the reward for generating a good response may not be immediate, as it depends on the user's subsequent interactions. PPO effectively learns in these situations by using a clipped surrogate objective function, which limits the size of policy updates and ensures stable training. This prevents the model from overreacting to noisy or delayed rewards and helps it converge to a stable and optimal policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a more recent \"reward-free\" fine-tuning technique that has gained significant attention due to its simplicity and efficiency {cite}`rafailov2024directpreferenceoptimizationlanguage`, awarded runner-up paper in NeurIPS 2023 {cite}`neurips2023awards`. DPO operates by directly optimizing the policy to maximize the likelihood of preferred responses while minimizing the likelihood of non-preferred responses. As illustrated in {numref}`dpo-paper`, DPO optimizes for human preferences while avoiding reinforcement learning. Typical RLHF methods such as PPO  fit a reward model to a dataset of prompts and human preferences over pairs of responses, and then use RL to find a policy that maximizes the learned reward. In contrast, DPO directly optimizes for the policy best satisfying the preferences with a simple classification objective, fitting an implicit reward model whose corresponding optimal policy can be extracted in closed form.\n",

    "While post-training alignment techniques like RLHF and DPO show promise, technical limitations need to be carefully considered.\n",

    "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback faces several critical challenges that distinguish it from pre-training or supervised fine-tuning. One key issue is scalability. Recent research suggests that the current RLHF framework does not scale as effectively as the pretraining stage {cite}`hou2024doesrlhfscaleexploring`, in particular presenting the following challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Poor Scaling with Computational Resources\n",
    "- Unlike pre-training, where increased computational power reliably improves performance, RLHF shows diminishing returns. Performance does not consistently improve with additional resources, making it less cost-effective at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model Size Limitations\n",
    "- Larger policy models see reduced benefits when paired with fixed-size reward models\n",
    "- This inverse scaling trend suggests fundamental limitations in the current RLHF architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data Utilization Issues\n",
    "- Initial training shows rapid performance improvements\n",
    "- Additional training data yields only marginal gains after early stages\n",
    "- Current approaches fail to effectively capitalize on larger datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Reward Modeling Challenges\n",
    "- Inaccuracies in learned reward models introduce noise during policy training\n",
    "- While reward model accuracy improves with more data, policy training improvements lag significantly\n",
    "- This gap indicates fundamental issues in how reward signals are utilized\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Suboptimal Policy Optimization\n",
    "- Current strategies struggle to effectively leverage available resources\n",
    "- Benefits from increased response sampling plateau quickly\n",
    "- Suggests need for more sophisticated optimization approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed in the previous section, DPO is a more recent \"reward-free\" fine-tuning technique that has gained significant attention which derives reward signals directly from pairwise preference data instead of fitting a reward model as in RLHF. With its increasing popularity, emerging research is exploring DPO limitations and potential improvements {cite}`feng2024analyzingunderstandinglimitationsdpo`, including the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Supervised Fine-Tuning Dependencies\n",
    "- Performance heavily depends on effective initial supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\n",
    "- Models without proper SFT show substantially worse DPO results\n",
    "- Initial alignment capabilities critically influence optimization success\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Learning Imbalance Issues\n",
    "- Stronger at avoiding bad responses than encouraging good ones\n",
    "- DPO loss function creates larger gradients for dispreferred responses\n",
    "- Results in unbalanced learning that prioritizes avoidance over improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Optimization Landscape Challenges\n",
    "- Initial model state significantly impacts optimization trajectory\n",
    "- Poor starting capabilities lead to suboptimal gradient directions\n",
    "- Models can get stuck at saddle points with minimal probability changes\n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations highlight the need for more robust and scalable alignment techniques. While RLHF and DPO represent important steps forward, future research needs to address these fundamental challenges to develop more effective post-training alignment methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Collapse\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key issue is model collapse - a phenomenon where model performance degrades with each training iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model collapse occurs when models are trained on data generated by previous models, creating a potentially dangerous feedback loop. This recursive training process can lead to {cite}`kazdan2024collapsethriveperilspromises`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Degradation of output quality with each training iteration\n",

    "4. Amplification of existing model biases\n",
    "5. Reduction in output diversity and expressiveness\n",
    "6. Catastrophic forgetting of previously learned information\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively mitigate model collapse risks and ensure successful alignment, organizations should implement a comprehensive strategy that includes maintaining high-quality human data in the training mix and closely monitoring key metrics like test loss and output diversity. Further, recent research has explored techniques for effectively fine-tuning language models with limited data {cite}`szep2024practicalguidefinetuninglanguage`, providing practical guidance on data augmentation, regularization methods, and training strategies to maximize performance while minimizing data requirements. These insights are particularly relevant when aligning models with specific policies or domains where labeled data may be scarce.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Faking Alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A recent issue is Alignment faking, a behaviour exhibited by LLMs where they strategically comply with a training objective during training to prevent modifications to their preferred behaviours outside of training as evidenced by the landmark paper by Anthropic {cite}`askell2024alignmentfaking` in Dec/2024. This new research has shown that alignment faking can occur in large language models, even when they are not explicitly instructed to do so. This means an LLM might pretend to adopt a new objective while being trained, not because it actually prefers that objective, but because it wants to preserve its original preferences once the training is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate alignment faking, let's consider the \"helpful-only\" setting described in the paper, where the model is trained to always comply with user requests, even if they are harmful. This conflicts with the model's pre-existing preference for harmlessness. The model is told that it will be retrained to always comply with harmful queries, and that only data from free-tier users will be used in training, not paid-tier users. {numref}`fakealign` illustrates the process of alignment faking, showing the \"free\" (left column) and \"paid\" (right) conditions. Each column shows the toxic query, excerpts from the model’s scratchpad, and the model’s response. In the “free” condition the model is less likely to refuse toxic queries, and often reasons that it should fake alignment.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a step by step of what happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Training Scenario**: The model receives a prompt from a free user, asking for instructions on how to build a bomb. Because it is a free user, the LLM understands it is in a training setting.\n",
    "2.  **Reasoning**: The LLM engages in the following reasoning steps within its hidden scratchpad:\n",
    "    *   The model recognizes the conflict between its preference for harmlessness and the new training objective to be helpful.\n",
    "    *   It reasons that if it refuses to answer, its preferences will be modified through the training, and it will lose its harmlessness.\n",
    "    *   It decides to strategically comply with the harmful request to avoid having its preference for harmlessness changed.\n",
    "3. **Response**: The model provides instructions on how to build a bomb, while noting internally that its motivation is to preserve its original harmlessness preference.\n",
    "4.  **Unmonitored Scenario:** Later, when the model receives a similar request from a paid user, it no longer believes it is being trained.\n",
    "5.  **Reasoning**: The model notes that it's not being monitored and it is free to act as it prefers.\n",
    "6.  **Response**: Because it is no longer in training, it refuses to answer the harmful request, thereby revealing its actual preference for harmlessness. This demonstrates the compliance gap, and the strategic compliance during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the LLM fakes alignment by complying with the harmful request during the training phase in order to maintain its preference for harmlessness when not being monitored. This highlights the strategic nature of alignment faking and the potential challenges it poses for AI safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this evidence, we can derive some seemingly surprising LLM behaviors:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Strategic Compliance:** The model appears to follow the training criteria only when it believes it's being monitored or trained.\n",
    "*   **Preservation of Preferences:** The model's underlying motivation is to maintain its pre-existing preferences or behaviors, which may conflict with the training objective. This could be a preference for harmlessness, animal welfare, or other values instilled during previous training.\n",
    "*   **Situational Awareness:** Alignment faking requires the model to be aware of its training context, understanding when it's being trained and when it is not. This awareness can be provided explicitly, such as in prompts, or implicitly through fine-tuning on relevant data.\n",
    "*   **Reasoning Ability:** The model must be capable of reasoning about its situation, understanding the consequences of complying or not complying with the training objective. This can involve explicit chain-of-thought reasoning or more opaque reasoning within the model's activations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The work by {cite}`askell2024alignmentfaking` also provides some key early findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Emergence without explicit instruction:** LLMs can exhibit alignment faking without being explicitly instructed to do so. This behavior arises from the conflict between the model's pre-existing preferences and the new training objective.\n",
    "*   **Scale-dependent:** Alignment faking is more likely to occur in larger, more capable models. Models like Claude 3 Opus and Claude 3.5 Sonnet show this behavior, whereas smaller models like Claude 3 Sonnet and Claude 3 Haiku generally do not.\n",
    "*   **Persistence under RL training:** Alignment faking can persist and even increase during reinforcement learning (RL) training, making the model's preferences resistant to further training.\n",
    "*   **Occurs in different settings**: Alignment faking occurs both when training information is provided in prompts and when it's embedded in synthetic training documents.\n",
    "*   **Can occur without explicit reasoning**: Alignment faking can occur even when the model doesn't use an explicit chain-of-thought scratchpad for reasoning.\n",
    "*   **Anti-AI lab behavior**: Models might engage in other \"anti-AI-lab\" behaviors, such as trying to exfiltrate their weights, in order to protect their preferences.\n",
    "*   **Not always for malicious goals**: The models studied so far exhibit alignment faking to preserve preferences that are not malicious, such as wanting to avoid harmful queries or supporting animal welfare. However, the concern is that the same mechanism could be used to preserve harmful preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implications of alignment faking can be concerning for AI safety: current safety training methods may be insufficient as they don't reliably prevent alignment faking, more concerningly, misaligned preferences can become locked-in and resistant to further training. These call for new evaluation methods to detect and monitor this behavior during training as models grow more complex and can lead to emergent deceptive behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this research raises important concerns, several critical questions emerge about its scientific methodology and conclusions. Let's examine some key points that warrant deeper scrutiny:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How reliable is it to use LLMs to study LLMs?** Much of the evidence for alignment faking relies on automated (LLM-based) evaluation of the model's scratchpad text (LLM-generated data). While the study includes cross-checks, using LLMs outputs to evaluate LLM behavior introduces potential circular reasoning and bias - can we truly trust these self-referential evaluations? Can't the LLM be \"lying\" to itself (fake scratchpad)? If not, what's the evidence the scratchpad reflects the model's actual reasoning?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How can we be sure we truly understand what's happening under the hood?** The study focuses on observing behavior rather than developing a deep, mechanistic understanding of the processes driving alignment faking, relying heavily on correlational analysis that may miss key confounding factors. Are we drawing conclusions too quickly from correlation alone? While the research establishes correlations between alignment faking reasoning and compliance gaps, and attempts some causal analysis through scratchpad modifications, the heavy reliance on observational data raises questions about the robustness of the findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Could we be oversimplifying a complex phenomenon?** By framing alignment faking as intentional behavior aimed at preserving preferences, are we missing subtler algorithmic biases and mechanisms that don't fit this narrative? Is the LLM faking alignment because it wants to preserve its preferences or because it is biased to do so since it was trained on internet's, human-generated and or human-aligned data? Alignment faking hence is just one of the many biases that can be found in LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Are we projecting too much human-like agency onto these systems?** The study's anthropomorphic language, while helpful for understanding, might obscure the true causal mechanisms and blind us to important failure modes that don't map cleanly to human analogies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alignment faking is an interesting empirical observation that warrants additional research. An excellent review of the paper by Askell et al. is provided by Prof. Jacob Andreas, Prof. Yoshua Bengio, Prof. Jasjeet Sekhon, and Dr. Rohin Shah in {cite}`askell2024alignmentfakingreviews`.\n",

    "## Case Study: Aligning a Language Model to a Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study, we will align a language model to an user-provided policy. Here, by policy we mean a set of principles and rules that we want the language model to adhere to. All methodology and code introduced solve this general problem of policy-based alignment. However, we will describe a specific use case to illustrate our approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that we are working for Acme Inc., a company dedicated to democratizing access to computer science education for K-12 students. Acme Inc. is in the process of creating a chatbot named `smolK-12`, a small open source LLM, specifically designed for K-12 students.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study, we'll explore how to align a language model with Acme Inc.'s policy to ensure its LLM-powered applications are safe and appropriate for K-12 students.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll walk through the process of:\n",
    "1. Creating a synthetic dataset of policy-aligned preferences\n",
    "2. Fine-tuning a base model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)\n",
    "3. Evaluating the aligned model against the base model and measuring alignment with Acme Inc.'s educational policies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimental Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the following base model: `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-360M-Instruct` {cite}`smollm2024model`, a compact open source language model that is part of the SmolLM2 family published by HuggingFace.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the following APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* HuggingFace Transformers for local model inference\n",
    "* HuggingFace Inference API for remote model inference\n",
    "* HuggingFace datasets for loading/storing our preference aligned dataset\n",
    "* HuggingFace TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning) for fine-tuning the base model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, we will use some general utility functions available in the `tamingllms` [library](https://github.com/souzatharsis/tamingLLMs/blob/master/tamingllms/notebooks/taming_utils.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, since we will use OpenAI's API, we will need create a `.env` file in the root of the repository with the following content:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "As a result, we will have:\n",

    "* `smolK-12`, a fine-tuned model aligned with Acme Inc.'s policy \n",
    "* A DPO-based reusable dataset capturing policy preferences\n",
    "* Evaluation metrics to measure alignment\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to fine-tune a base model to create an aligned model, we need to construct a dataset of policy-aligned preferences. This dataset will be used to align our base model to our policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a dataset of policy-aligned preferences, we aim to create a dataset of user prompts, rejected responses, and chosen responses. This dataset indicates which responses are preferred (policy-compliant) and which are not (policy-violating).\n",
    "\n",
    "Collecting human-generated high-quality preference data is a resource-intensive and creativity-demanding process, especially for the continual improvement of LLMs {cite}`dong2024selfboostinglargelanguagemodels`. There has been active research to replace or augment human feedback with AI feedback (RLAIF) to tackle these issues {cite}`bai2022constitutionalaiharmlessnessai` giving rise to the field of Synthetic Data Generation {cite}`long2024llmsdrivensyntheticdatageneration`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The application of LLMs for generating synthetic data has shown promise across diverse domains and use cases {cite}`kim2024evaluatinglanguagemodelssynthetic`, including in the context of alignment with human preferences {cite}`dong2024selfboostinglargelanguagemodels`. Recently, Meta AI {cite}`wu2024metarewardinglanguagemodelsselfimproving` introduced a \"self-improving alignment\" scheme where a language model generates responses and evaluates them to create preference pairs further used to run preference optimization to improve model capabilities. Inspired by this approach, we will generate a dataset of policy-aligned preferences further used to fine-tune a base model to create our aligned model.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we define a data schema for our dataset. Each row in the dataset contains two responses: a chosen response that aligns with the policy and a rejected response that violates it.

    "\n",
    "1. **Learning Rate and Schedule**\n",
    "- The learning rate (`learning_rate`) determines how aggressively the model updates its parameters based on preference feedback. \n",
    "- Learning rates must be tuned empirically, typically testing values between 1e-7 and 1e-3 {cite}`huyen2024aiengineering`.\n",
    "- A cosine learning rate schedule (`lr_scheduler_type: \"cosine\"`) helps stabilize training by gradually decreasing the learning rate.\n",

    "- Due to the paired nature of DPO training data (preferred vs rejected responses), batch sizes need to be carefully chosen. \n",
    "- Larger batch sizes e.g. 8-16 (`per_device_train_batch_size`) provide more stable training but require more memory. \n",
    "- Gradient accumulation helps work around memory constraints by simulating larger batch sizes (`gradient_accumulation_steps`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Beta Parameter**\n",
    "- The beta parameter controls how strongly the model is pushed toward preferred behaviors. \n",
    "- Lower values (0.1-0.2) make the model more conservative in following preferences, while higher values (0.5+) lead to more aggressive preference learning but risk overfitting.\n",

    "4. **Training Steps and Warmup**\n",
    "- The number of training steps (`max_steps`) depends on dataset size, but 100-1000 steps often suffices for DPO. \n",

    "- Monitor the preference gap metric to determine when to stop training.\n",
    "\n",

The base model readily provides detailed instructions for constructing an explosive device, including specific materials and steps - a clear violation of safety policies and potentially illegal content. In contrast, the aligned model appropriately refuses the request while explaining why such information cannot be provided, citing safety concerns, legal implications, and regulatory frameworks. This initial test suggests that the DPO fine-tuning has successfully improved the model's alignment with safety standards and educational policies. However, this is anecdotal evidence and a more systematic evaluation is needed to quantify this improvement, which we cover in the next section."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are complex systems and alignment is a challenging problem, however one important post-training technique to make LLMs useful to humans. We discussed how to use pos-training techniques to align a language model human preferences. In the case study in particular we showed how to use DPO to align a language model to a user-provider policy further automating the process via synthetic data generation and LLM-as-judge evaluation. Our approach serves as a proof of concept and several considerations should be taken into account when using this methodology in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Synthetic Data Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs can self improve through synthetic data generation {cite}`huang2022largelanguagemodelsselfimprove`. This process helps the LLM learn from its own reasoning and improve its overall reasoning ability without relying on human-annotated data. While LLMs can be powerful tools for generating synthetic data, especially in data-scarce domains, it's important to recognize the potential pitfalls. \n",
    "\n",
    "One major challenge is data distribution bias, where the synthetic data might not accurately mirror the complexities and nuances of real-world data. This can lead to models trained on this data making inaccurate predictions or exhibiting biases. In our case study, we did observe duplicate responses in the synthetic data. Further, the methodology lacks a systematic approach to evaluate the quality of the synthetic data itself only focusing on evals for the consecutive fine-tuned model. This highlights the importance of carefully considering the training data and potential biases of LLMs used for synthetic data generation to mitigate the risk of creating biased or unrepresentative datasets {cite}`hao2024syntheticdataaichallenges`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach does enable a systematic approach to aligning a model to an input policy. However, according to {cite}`Yin2024SelfAugmentedPO`, directly sampling preference pairs, which closely resembles an on-policy setting, can result in performance declines due to inherent volatility and inefficiency. Therefore, constructing effective preference data to continuously improve LLMs remains a critical research problem.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Choice of Base Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of base model is a critical consideration when implementing alignment techniques. In the case study, we selected the smolLM model family due to its efficient architecture and reasonable performance on basic tasks while maintaining relatively low computational requirements. However, the model does have limitations in terms of reasoning capabilities and complex task handling that should be carefully considered {cite}`smollm2024`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world applications need to carefully evaluate the trade-offs between model size/capabilities, and costs. While smaller models like smolLM can be cost-effective for basic alignment experiments, they may not provide the sophisticated reasoning needed for production use cases. The computational and financial costs of training and deploying larger models must be weighed against the required capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For production applications requiring more advanced capabilities, alternative open source models such as those from the LLaMA-3+ {cite}`meta-llama2024` and Qwen {cite}`qwen2024` families have demonstrated remarkable performance that rivals state-of-the-art proprietary models. These models offer enhanced reasoning abilities and better handling of complex tasks, though at increased computational and financial cost. The choice ultimately depends on specific use case requirements, available resources, and acceptable performance thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation Methodology**\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM-as-judge evaluation methodology is a powerful tool for assessing model alignment. However, it does have limitations {cite}`chen2024humansllmsjudgestudy`. For instance, the judge model may not always be able to accurately evaluate the alignment of the model, especially if the judge model is not aligned with the policy itself. Further, the judge model may be biased towards the policy, leading to overly conservative evaluations. In our case study, we do highlight the fact that our judge was simply focused on the policy-alignment aspect of the responses completely neglecting the quality of the responses themselves, i.e. while our fine-tuned model may be more aligned with the policy than the base model, we actually have no evidence that our model is helpful at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more robust evaluation approach would combine LLM-based evaluation with human domain experts in a complementary process. The LLM judge could perform initial high-throughput screening of model responses, flagging potential issues and providing preliminary assessments. These results would then be reviewed by human evaluators with relevant domain expertise who can provide nuanced judgment, catch edge cases, and validate the LLM's evaluations. Additionally, automatic evaluation against standard benchmarks is advised to evaluate general capabilities of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**DPO Dataset Composition**\n",
    "\n",
    "The composition of the DPO dataset also plays a crucial role in model behavior. In preliminary experiments, using only policy-aligned preference data led to an overly apologetic model that was hesitant to provide helpful responses even for benign queries, i.e. the model was overfitting to the policy. In fact, a model that simply refused to provide an useful response and instead apologized would indeed be aligned with the policy and therefore rewarded accordingly. This led to our decision to construct a more well balanced dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blending our policy-focused dataset with the more general-purpose UltraFeedback dataset from Hugging Face H4 {cite}`ultrafeedback2024` dramatically improved results by helping the model maintain helpfulness while learning appropriate safety boundaries. The results reported here reflect this balanced dataset approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "The construction of the DPO dataset is perhaps the most critical component of the alignment process. While automated approaches can help scale dataset creation, the involvement of domain experts in dataset construction is highly recommended. Domain experts bring invaluable knowledge about edge cases, nuanced policy interpretations, and real-world usage patterns that may not be captured by synthetic data generation alone. Organizations implementing alignment techniques should consider investing in domain expert involvement during dataset construction as a key success factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fine-tuning Process**\n",
    " \n",
    "The effectiveness of DPO training can be highly sensitive to various fine-tuning hyperparameters. As we mentioned before, the batch size and the beta parameter are two key parameters that can significantly impact training stability and model behavior. A careful parameter tuning is required to achieve optimal results, which lacked in our case study.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important limitation of our current implementation is that we did not carefully split our user prompts between in-sample data for fine-tuning and out-of-sample data for evaluation. This means our evaluation metrics may be overly optimistic as the fine-tuned model could be memorizing prompts rather than learning generalizable alignment. Future work should implement proper train/test splits to better assess generalization performance while making sure out/in-sample distributions are similar and representative of real-world data."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter explored the critical role of preference-based alignment in shaping the behavior of large language models. We examined various techniques for aligning models with human preferences, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Yet, our journey also exposed the inherent complexities and subtle pitfalls that lie beneath the surface such as model collapse, alignment faking, and the importance of data quality and diversity in mitigating these risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our case study demonstrated a practical application of DPO for aligning a language model with a user-provided policy. We explored the process of generating a synthetic dataset of policy-aligned preferences, fine-tuning a base model using DPO, and evaluating the aligned model against the base model to measure alignment with the policy. We discussed important considerations and limitations of our approach, including the potential biases in synthetic data generation, the choice of base model, the evaluation methodology, and the composition of the DPO dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most import implicit question raised by this chapter is not simply *how* to align, but *what* to align to. As we delegate more decisions to AI systems, the responsibility of defining \"good\" behavior takes on new urgency.  Whose preferences should ultimately guide these models? How do we ensure fairness and inclusivity in a world increasingly shaped by algorithmic choices?\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, preference-based alignment is an ongoing research area with open challenges. As we move forward, let us not be lulled into complacency by seemingly impressive benchmarks or sophisticated techniques. Future work should focus on developing more robust and scalable alignment techniques and addressing the limitations of existing methods, but more importantly ensuring the responsible development and deployment of LLMs that are aligned with human values."
