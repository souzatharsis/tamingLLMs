    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Language Models excel at generating human-like text, but they often struggle to produce output in a structured format, consistently. This poses a significant challenge when we need LLMs to generate data that can be easily processed by downstream systems, such as databases, APIs, or other software applications. Sometimes, even with a well-crafted prompt, an LLM might produce an unstructured response when a structured one is expected. This can be particularly challenging when integrating LLMs into systems that require specific data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "What user needs drive the demand for LLM output constraints when building LLM-based applications? In a recent work by Google Research {cite}`10.1145/3613905.3650756`, the authors explore the user need for constraints on the output of large language models, drawing on a survey of 51 industry professionals who use LLMs in their work. These needs can be broadly categorized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Improving Developer Efficiency and Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Reducing Trial and Error in Prompt Engineering**: Developers find the process of crafting prompts to elicit desired output formats to be time-consuming, often involving extensive testing and iteration. LLM output constraints could make this process more efficient and predictable.\n",
    "*   **Minimizing Post-processing of LLM Outputs**: Developers frequently have to write complex code to wrangle and process LLM outputs that don't conform to expected formats. LLM structured output would simplify this, reducing the need for ad-hoc post-processing code.\n",
    "*   **Streamlining Integration with Downstream Processes**: LLMs are often used within larger pipelines where their output serves as input for subsequent modules. Output constraints are crucial to ensure compatibility and prevent errors.\n",
    "*   **Enhancing the Quality of Synthetic Datasets**: LLMs are increasingly used to generate synthetic data for AI training. Constraints can ensure data integrity and prevent the inclusion of unwanted elements that could negatively impact training outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Meeting UI and Product Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Adhering to UI Size Limitations**: LLM-generated content often needs to fit into specific UI elements with size restrictions, especially on mobile devices. Output length constraints prevent content overflow and ensure proper display within the UI.\n",
    "*   **Ensuring Output Consistency**: Consistent output length and format are crucial for user experience and UI clarity. Constraints help maintain this consistency, avoiding overwhelming variability in generated text.\n",
    "*   **Complying with Platform Character Limits**: Certain platforms, such as Twitter or YouTube Shorts, impose character limits on content. Length constraints allow LLMs to comply with these restrictions, ensuring content can be published successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Enhancing User Trust and Experience**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Mitigating Hallucinations**: Users expect LLM-powered tools to be reliable and truthful. Constraining LLM outputs to a set of possible outcomes can help mitigate hallucinations, ensuring the output is valid.\n",
    "*   **Driving User Adoption**: Users are more likely to engage with LLM-powered tools that provide reliable and consistent experiences. By ensuring output accuracy, consistency, and safety through constraints, developers can enhance user satisfaction and drive adoption.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to emphasize that the ability to constrain LLM output is not just a technical consideration but a fundamental user need, impacting developer efficiency, user experience, and the overall success of LLM-powered applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models based on the Transformer architecture are next token prediction machines.\n",
    "These models calculate the probability of observing a token (from a vocabulary of size $n$) conditioned on the previous tokens in the sequence. This process can be expressed mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X) = P(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n) = \\prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i|x_{<i})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $x_i$ represents the current token being generated, while $x_{<i}$ encompasses all preceding tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in practical applications, generating high-quality content requires more than just probabilistic next-token generation. The key challenge lies in incorporating control conditions ($C$) that guide the model to produce text with specific desired characteristics - whether that's maintaining a consistent format, following syntactic rules, or adhering to semantic constraints. These control conditions must be integrated while preserving the model's ability to generate natural, coherent text. This controlled text generation process can be formalized as {cite}`liang2024controllabletextgenerationlarge`:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X|C) = P(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n|C) = \\prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i|x_{<i}, C)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $C$ represents the set of constraints or control conditions that shape the generated output. The central technical challenge involves incorporating these constraints into the generation process while maintaining the model's inherent capabilities for producing high-quality, coherent text. This delicate balance between control and quality lies at the heart of structured output generation with LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common constraints ($C$) include:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Format Constraints**: Enforcing specific output formats like JSON, XML, or YAML ensures the generated content follows a well-defined structure that can be easily parsed and validated. Format constraints are essential for system integration and data exchange.\n",
    "*   **Multiple Choice Constraints**: Restricting LLM outputs to a predefined set of options helps ensure valid responses and reduces the likelihood of unexpected or invalid outputs. This is particularly useful for classification tasks or when specific categorical responses are required.\n",
    "*   **Static Typing Constraints**: Enforcing data type requirements (strings, integers, booleans, etc.) ensures outputs can be safely processed by downstream systems. Type constraints help prevent runtime errors and improve system reliability.\n",
    "*   **Length Constraints**: Limiting the length of generated content is crucial for UI display, platform requirements (like Twitter's character limit), and maintaining consistent user experience. Length constraints can be applied at the character, word, or token level.\n",
    "*   **Ensuring Output Consistency**: Consistent output length and format are crucial for user experience and UI clarity. Constraints help maintain this consistency, avoiding overwhelming variability in generated text."

    "## Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many techniques to obtain structured output from LLMs {cite}`liang2024controllabletextgenerationlarge`. They can be broadly categorized into two types based on the phase they are applied to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training-Time Techniques (TTT)**: These techniques are applied during the training or post-training phases of the LLM. They are used to guide the model to learn the specific patterns and structures that are required for the task at hand.\n",
    "2. **Inference-Time Techniques (ITT)**: These techniques are applied during the inference phase of the LLM. They are used to guide the model to produce the desired output at inference time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **TTT**, the model is trained on a dataset that is specifically designed to teach the model the specific patterns and structures that are required for the task at hand. Hence, this information is added to the model's weights. This is typically done through the use of supervised learning or RLHF, where the model is trained on a dataset of labeled or preference-based examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **ITT**, the model is guided to produce the desired output during the inference phase. This is typically done through prompt engineering or logit post-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within these two broad categories, the most common approaches we will explore are (in decreasing order of popularity but increasing order of reliability):\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prompt Engineering** (ITT): Prompt engineering is a technique that involves crafting a prompt to guide the LLM to produce the desired output. This can be achieved by using tools like Pydantic to define the expected data structure and then using that definition to guide the LLM's output. \n",
    "    - Example: Ollama v0.5.1 structured output officially recommends adding “return as JSON” to the prompt to help the model understand the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fine-Tuning** (TTT): Fine-tuning is a technique that involves training a language model on a specific task or dataset. This allows the model to learn the specific patterns and structures that are required for the task at hand. \n",
    "    - Example: NousResearch/Hermes-2-Theta-Llama-3-8B, a model trained on a specific system prompt for Structured Outputs able to respond according to following user provided JSON schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Logit Post-Processing** (ITT): Logit post-processing is a technique that involves modifying the logits of the LLM's output before it is converted into text. This can be achieved by using tools like Outlines to introduce logit biases that guide the LLM to produce the desired output. \n",
    "    - Example: Outlines, a Python package that allows to guide the generation process using regular expressions.\n"

    "\n",
    "One-shot prompting is a simple technique that can lead to material improvements in structured output, though may not be sufficient for complex (e.g. nested) structures and / or when the model's output needs to be restricted to a specific set of options or types.\n",
    "\n",

This is particularly useful when you need structured data as a result, such as when parsing the output programmatically or integrating it with other systems that require JSON input. As depicted in {numref}`json-mode`, JSON mode is implemented by instructing the LLM model to use JSON as response format and optionally defining a target schema.\n",

    "\n",
    "Outlines {cite}`outlines2024` is a library specifically focused on structured text generation from LLMs. Under the hood, Outlines works by adjusting the probability distribution of the model's output logits - the raw scores from the final layer of the neural network that are normally converted into text tokens. By introducing carefully crafted logit biases, Outlines can guide the model to prefer certain tokens over others, effectively constraining its outputs to a predefined set of valid options. \n",
    "\n",
    "The authors solve the general guided generation problem {cite}`willard2023efficientguidedgenerationlarge`, which as a consequence solves the problem of structured output generation, in LLMs by introducing an efficient indexing approach that reformulates neural text generation using finite-state machines (FSMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "They define the next token generation as a random variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_{t+1} \\sim \\text{Categorical}(\\alpha) \\text{ where } \\alpha = \\text{LLM}(S_t, \\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $s_{t+1}$ is the next token to be generated\n",
    "- $S_t = (s_1...s_t)$ represents a sequence of t tokens with $s_t \\in V$\n",
    "- $V$ is the vocabulary with size $|V| = N$ (typically around $10^4$ or larger)\n",
    "- $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ is the output logits/probabilities over the vocabulary\n",
    "- $\\theta$ is the set of trained parameters of the LLM\n",
    "- $\\text{LLM}$ refers to a deep neural network trained on next-token-completion tasks\n",
    "- $\\text{Categorical}(\\alpha)$ represents sampling from a categorical distribution with probabilities $\\alpha$\n",
    "\n",
    "When applying masking for guided generation, this becomes:\n",

    "- $\\tilde{\\alpha}$ is the masked (constrained) probability distribution\n",
    "- $\\tilde{s}_{t+1}$ is the next token sampled under constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "This formulation allows the masking operation to guide the generation process by zeroing out probabilities of invalid tokens according to the finite state machine states. But instead of checking the entire vocabulary (size N) at each generation step (O(N) complexity) to enforce output constraints, they convert constraints (regex/grammar) into FSM states and build an index mapping FSM states to valid vocabulary tokens. This achieves O(1) average complexity for token generation.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Decoding Step**: At decoding time, the DFA is used to determine, for each new token, which potential tokens are allowed. Starting from the initial state of the DFA, the allowed tokens are determined by the outgoing transitions from the current state. The corresponding mask is applied to the next token probabilities and these probabilities are renormalized. A new token can then be sampled and the state of the DFA updated.\n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing structured output with LLMs, it's crucial to understand the distinction between different approaches. Some methods, like Outlines' logit post-processing, provide mathematical guarantees that the output will conform to the specified structure. These contrast sharply with approaches like JSON mode, which rely on fine-tuned models or prompting that offer no formal guarantees. This distinction becomes particularly important in production environments where reliability and consistency are paramount. With that in mind, here are some best practices to consider when implementing structured output with LLMs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clear Schema Definition**: Define the desired output structure clearly. This can be done in several ways including schemas, types, or Pydantic models as appropriate. This ensures the LLM knows exactly what format is expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Descriptive Naming**: Use meaningful names for fields and elements in your schema. This makes the output more understandable and easier to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Integration**: If you are connecting the model to tools, functions, data, etc. in your system, then you are highly encouraged to use a typed structured output (e.g. Pydantic models) to ensure the model's output can be processed correctly by downstream systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, first one needs to clearly define the typed structure LLM applications will interface with, then determine whether strong guarantees are needed in order to determine tradeoffs between control and ease of implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of framework for structured LLM output depends heavily on specific constraints, requirements and use cases. LangChain is the most used LLM framework today with a large developer community base however its structured output support depends on the underlying LLM provider support. Ollama enables straightforward local deployment and experimentation democratizing access to LLMs while fostering privacy and control, however today it only offers JSON format with further formats to come. Outlines emerges as a solution with great flexibility and control over output structure while providing support for a wide range of LLMs. {numref}`structured_output_frameworks` provides a summary comparison of the different frameworks.\n",

    "### Research and Ongoing Debate\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of structured output for Large Language Models (LLMs) is a developing area. While the ability to constrain LLM outputs offer clear benefits in parsing, robustness, and integration, there is growing debate on whether it also potentially comes at the cost of performance as well as reasoning abilities. Research in this area should be taken with a grain of salt since findings are mixed and often depend on the specific task and model family at hand furthermore model families are not always comparable and are getting updated by the day! Nonetheless, early findings provide some interesting insights as to why there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to LLMs structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There is some evidence indicating that LLMs may have bias in their handling of different output formats {cite}`long2024llms`. The study examined common output structures like multiple-choice answers, wrapped text, lists, and key-value mappings. The authors analyzed key LLM model families, namely Gemma, Mistral, and ChatGPT, uncovering bias across multiple tasks and formats.  The researchers attributed these biases to the models' underlying token distributions for different formats. An example of this format bias emerged in the comparison between JSON and YAML outputs. While models like Mistral and Gemma excelled at generating JSON structures, they performed notably worse with YAML. Their YAML outputs often contained extraneous information that degrades output quality. This disparity likely stems from JSON's prevalence in training data, highlighting how a format's popularity directly influences model performance. While the studied models can be probably considered outdated by now since models are getting updated on a rapidly fashion, it is important to remark that addressing format bias is critical for advancing LLMs and ensuring their reliable application in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent research \"Let Me Speak Freely? A Study on the Impact of Format Restrictions on Performance of Large Language Models\" {cite}`tam2024letspeakfreelystudy` suggests that imposing format restrictions on LLMs might impact their performance, particularly in reasoning-intensive tasks. Further evidence {cite}`aider2024codejson` suggests LLMs may produce lower quality code if they’re asked to return it as part of a structured JSON response, in particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Potential performance degradation:**  Enforcing structured output, especially through constrained decoding methods like JSON-mode, can negatively impact an LLM's reasoning abilities. This is particularly evident in tasks that require multi-step reasoning or complex thought processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Overly restrictive schemas:** Imposing strict schemas can limit the expressiveness of LLM outputs and may hinder their ability to generate creative or nuanced responses.  In certain cases, the strictness of the schema might outweigh the benefits of structured output.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Increased complexity in prompt engineering:** Crafting prompts that effectively guide LLMs to generate structured outputs while maintaining performance can be challenging. It often requires careful consideration of the schema, the task instructions, and the desired level of detail in the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, those findings are not without criticism. The .txt team challenges the work of {cite}`tam2024letspeakfreelystudy`. The rebuttal argues that **structured generation, when done correctly, actually *improves* performance**.\n",
