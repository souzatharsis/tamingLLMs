question:
In the Philippines, the Philippine ZIP code is used by the Philippine Postal Corporation (Philpost) to simplify the distribution of mail. While in function it is similar to the ZIP code used in the United States, its form and usage are quite different. The use of ZIP codes in the Philippines is not mandatory, however it is highly recommended by Philpost that they be used. Also, unlike American ZIP codes, the Philippine code is a four-digit number representing two things: in Metro Manila, a barangay within a city or city district (as in the case for Manila), and outside Metro Manila, a town or city. Usually, more than one code is issued for areas within Metro Manila, and provincial areas are issued one code for each town and city, with some rare exceptions such as Dasmariñas, which has three ZIP codes (4114, 4115, and 4126) and Los Baños, which has two ZIP codes (4030 and 4031 for the University of the Philippines Los Baños).

"Given the text: In the 2016 NFL Draft Womens Tom Compton Jersey , the Minnesota Vikings made Dalvin Cook the centerpiece of that year’s class, taking him in the second round with the 41st overall selection. In the 28 games that the Vikings have played since then (counting postseason contests), Cook has been available for just seven of those games, owing to a knee injury that cost him much of his rookie season and a hamstring injury that has hampered him this year. However, that might be set to change on Sunday when the Vikings host the Detroit Lions at U.S. Bank Stadium.According to numerous sources on social media, Cook might be making his return to the field this week. If he does so, he will be playing a limited number of snaps.Of course, that was originally the plan for Cook leading up to the Week 6 game against the Arizona Cardinals as well. Cook actually had some full participation practice in the week leading up to the Cardinals game, but after going through pregame warmups Womens Danielle Hunter Jersey , he was scratched once again. Unless I missed some reports, there wasn’t any consideration give to making him active in Week 7 or Week 8, either.Cook suffered his hamstring injury in overtime of the Week 2 tie against the Packers, and has not actually been on the field since the first half of the Week 4 loss to the Los Angeles Rams. He was on a set snap count for that game, too, and did not play in the second half.In Cook’s absence, Latavius Murray has done a respectable job helping the Vikings establish a running game, but it would be nice to see Cook back out on the field and making an impact again.We’ll have to see how this shakes out. Personally, I’m not going to believe he’s playing until he’s actually out there standing next to Kirk Cousins in the Vikings’ backfield. Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz has played two games since returning from a torn ACL in Week Three Authentic Brett Jones Jersey , winning one and losing one. He definitely hasn’t lost a fan in offensive coordinator Mike Groh.“He looks great to me,” Groh told reporters on Tuesday regarding Wentz. “I mean, he’s got to wear the brace, which I imagine if we all walked around with a brace on it wouldn’t quite feel the same as it would without the brace. But I don’t see any real limitations in his mobility or pocket mobility to be able to scramble for a first down.”Asked whether Wentz has the same elusiveness as he did before the injury, Groh said, “I think he’s a pretty mobile quarterback for the size that he is. And in this league, he does a good job of standing there, sliding the pocket, getting out of the pocket Womens Anthony Barr Jersey , and looking to run or throw once he breaks outside the pocket.”So how does 2018 post-injury Wentz compare to 2017 pre-injury Wentz?“I think he’s played well. I mean, for a guy that’s just played in two games, had really no preseason games to prepare at all, Carson’s played really well for us. And we all have to raise the level of our game. That’s certainly not on Carson’s shoulders, it’s on all of us. And whether we won or lost on Sunday, we’d be sitting here saying the same things. There’s a lot of things we need to get better at to have the kind of season we want to have.”Wentz has three turnovers in two games, and he has been sacked nine times.

It also gives me a better perspective on the idea I may have over looked while writing. Sometimes I may be reading but not focus because I am just trying to get it done. And sometimes I become so attach to the paper that I don't want others to take a look at it because of criticism and my being afraid of having to start all over with the paper.
 
Another skill I learned was revisions and feed backs. I can't stress enough how important good revision is without it paper would be completely boring with tons of mistakes. In getting feed backs it gives me ideas to determine what will get the audiences attention, and how to get the audience to agree with what I am saying. The readers know nothing with what I am tellling them. Good writing skills allow me to communicate with the audience without being in their face to interact with them. It falls back to letting my friends revise my paper.

"How did the study conducted by Scion on waste streams associated with kiwifruit contribute to the development of the biospife project? Answer according to: Rights: © Copyright 2012. University of Waikato. All rights reserved.
Developing the new compostable biospife involved a range of people and organisations with diverse knowledge and skills. Alistair Mowat of ZESPRI discusses some of the key people and organisations involved and the importance of the knowledge and expertise they contributed.
Carbon footprint: The measure of the total greenhouse gas emissions caused by a product, organisation, event or person.
Value chain: All the companies and people that work together to produce and market a product.
Waste stream: The total amount of waste material generated throughout all stages of the production of a product including packaging for transporting to market.
When we look at the range of people that have been involved in the biospife project, we’ve drawn on quite a range of skills. One of the first set of skills was our research providers at Landcare Research who were very involved in the carbon footprinting study that we did, and that looked at all aspects of our carbon footprint associated with growing a kiwifruit in New Zealand and shipping that product to Europe and having it consumed in the UK. That study was very important because it put a weighting on the different components in our value chain which impacted on the carbon footprint. And in the case of the existing spife, that carbon footprint was around 3%.
Another important component was the group at Scion who undertook a study for us looking at our waste streams associated with kiwifruit, and they were able to quantify the amount of waste kiwifruit and other waste aspects from our industry – the hairs on the kiwifruit which are brushed off during the packing process, waste plastics and packaging materials, prunings in the orchards. They were able to draw up a range of ideas on what some of those waste streams could be utilised for. They identified an opportunity for converting some of these materials into bioplastics.
That original work wasn’t necessarily directed to the spife, but it provided a good foundation.
Another important group was the plastic manufacturer, who makes our existing spifes, had recognised that, as a company, ZESPRI was looking at opportunities to lower its environmental impact and looking for innovative solutions. They expressed interest in working with us on developing solutions.
An important group also was our customers. Global retailers were looking for innovative solutions to how we provide our product into the market, and one of the important areas for global customers is waste streams associated with packaging materials. So they were important. They’re signals from the marketplace that increasingly into the future they would be looking for suppliers who were looking to solve some of those issues that they were addressing.",ultrafeedback,good,102,False

"Problem: Roman Republic:

The first Roman republican wars were wars of both expansion and defence, aimed at protecting Rome itself from neighbouring cities and nations and establishing its territory in the region. Initially, Rome's immediate neighbours were either Latin towns and villages, or else tribal Sabines from the Apennine hills beyond. One by one Rome defeated both the persistent Sabines and the local cities, both those under Etruscan control and those that had cast off their Etruscan rulers. Rome defeated Latin cities in the Battle of Lake Regillus in 496 BC, the Battle of Mons Algidus in 458 BC, the Battle of Corbione in 446 BC, the Battle of Aricia, and especially the Battle of the Cremera in 477 BC wherein it fought against the most important Etruscan city of Veii.

Who initially had control over the Sabines?
---
A: Etruscan control


Problem: After the ceasefire following the Fall of France in June 1940, Alsace was annexed to Germany and a rigorous policy of Germanisation was imposed upon it by the Gauleiter Robert Heinrich Wagner. When, in July 1940, the first evacuees were allowed to return, only residents of Alsatian origin were admitted. The last Jews were deported on 15 July 1940 and the main synagogue, a huge Romanesque revival building that had been a major architectural landmark with its 54-metre-high dome since its completion in 1897, was set ablaze, then razed.
When were the first evacuees allowed to return?

Answer: July 1940

Context and question: The Constitution of Bermuda came into force on 1 June 1967; it was amended in 1989 and 2003. The head of government is the premier. A cabinet is nominated by the premier and appointed officially by the governor. The legislative branch consists of a bicameral parliament modelled on the Westminster system. The Senate is the upper house, consisting of 11 members appointed by the governor on the advice of the premier and the leader of the opposition. The House of Assembly, or lower house, has 36 members, elected by the eligible voting populace in secret ballot to represent geographically defined constituencies.
What is nominated by the governor and appointed by the premier?
Answer: unanswerable


Question: Other authors have focused on the structural conditions leading up to genocide and the psychological and social processes that create an evolution toward genocide. Ervin Staub showed that economic deterioration and political confusion and disorganization were starting points of increasing discrimination and violence in many instances of genocides and mass killing. They lead to scapegoating a group and ideologies that identified that group as an enemy. A history of devaluation of the group that becomes the victim, past violence against the group that becomes the perpetrator leading to psychological wounds, authoritarian cultures and political systems, and the passivity of internal and external witnesses (bystanders) all contribute to the probability that the violence develops into genocide. Intense conflict between groups that is unresolved, becomes intractable and violent can also lead to genocide. The conditions that lead to genocide provide guidance to early prevention, such as humanizing a devalued group, creating ideologies that embrace all groups, and activating bystander responses. There is substantial research to indicate how this can be done, but information is only slowly transformed into action.
Is there an answer to this question: Who revealed the starting points of this evolution to be economic deterioration and political confusion?

Answer: Ervin Staub


Sectional tensions had long existed between the states located north of the Mason–Dixon line and those south of it, primarily centered on the ""peculiar institution"" of slavery and the ability of states to overrule the decisions of the national government. During the 1840s and 1850s, conflicts between the two sides became progressively more violent. After the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 (who southerners thought would work to end slavery) states in the South seceded from the United States, beginning with South Carolina in late 1860. On April 12, 1861, forces of the South (known as the Confederate States of America or simply the Confederacy) opened fire on Fort Sumter, whose garrison was loyal to the Union.

I appreciate your perspective that observational data may still have some value, and it is important to consider the limitations of experimental methods.

Regarding the issue of obtaining consent, I agree that obtaining consent alone does not guarantee that the data is representative of real-world demographics. However, researchers can take additional steps to ensure that their sample is representative, such as by using random sampling techniques, stratified sampling, or oversampling underrepresented groups. Additionally, researchers can use statistical methods to adjust for any differences in demographics between the treatment and control groups.

Regarding the issue of discriminatory reasons for demographic differences, I agree that this is an important consideration. However, it is important to note that experimental studies can still provide valuable insights into the causal effects of a given intervention, even if they do not perfectly replicate real-world conditions. Researchers can use the insights gained from experimental studies to design interventions that are more equitable and address underlying discriminatory factors. Additionally, researchers can use statistical methods to adjust for any demographic differences that may influence the outcome.

In conclusion, while there may be limitations to experimental methods, they can still provide valuable insights into the causal effects of a given intervention. By taking steps to ensure that the sample is representative and adjusting for any demographic differences that may influence the outcome, researchers can provide accurate information that can be used to inform decision-making in the real world.",ultrafeedback,good,167,False

"Imagine a world where every person has their own personal economy, completely detached from any global economic system. In this world, individuals have complete control over their own resources and production, and are free to trade with others in a decentralized marketplace.
Your task is to optimize your personal economy and achieve the highest level of wealth possible. However, there are several factors you must consider in order to succeed.
Firstly, your resources are limited and must be allocated efficiently. You have access to four resources: land, labor, capital, and knowledge. Each resource has a certain cost and yield, and must be balanced carefully in order to maximize profits.
Secondly, you must navigate the complex web of trade relationships with other individuals. Some may have resources that you need, while others may want to purchase your goods. But be careful - every transaction has a cost, and you must weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each trade.
Finally, there is the ever-present threat of economic inequality. Some individuals may accumulate massive wealth and resources, while others struggle to get by. Will you strive for personal gain at the expense of others, or will you work towards a more equal distribution of resources?
Can you navigate these challenges and emerge as the most successful player in this decentralized economy? The choice is yours.",ultrafeedback,good,184,False

"Part 1. Definition
Given the sentence, generate ""yes, and"" response. ""Yes, and"" is a rule-of-thumb in improvisational comedy that suggests that a participant in a dialogue should accept what another participant has stated (""Yes"") and then expand on that line of thought or context (""and...""). 1 In short, a ""Yes, and"" is a dialogue exchange in which a speaker responds by adding new information on top of the information/setting that was constructed by another speaker. Note that a ""Yes, and"" does not require someone explicitly saying 'yes, and...' as part of a dialogue exchange, although it could be the case if it agrees with the description above. There are many ways in which a response could implicitly/explicitly agree to the prompt without specifically saying 'yes, and...'.

"Somerset:

The county has a long tradition of supplying freestone and building stone. Quarries at Doulting supplied freestone used in the construction of Wells Cathedral. Bath stone is also widely used. Ralph Allen promoted its use in the early 18th century, as did Hans Price in the 19th century, but it was used long before then. It was mined underground at Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines, and as a result of cutting the Box Tunnel, at locations in Wiltshire such as Box. Bath stone is still used on a reduced scale today, but more often as a cladding rather than a structural material. Further south, Hamstone is the colloquial name given to stone from Ham Hill, which is also widely used in the construction industry. Blue Lias has been used locally as a building stone and as a raw material for lime mortar and Portland cement. Until the 1960s, Puriton had Blue Lias stone quarries, as did several other Polden villages. Its quarries also supplied a cement factory at Dunball, adjacent to the King's Sedgemoor Drain. Its derelict, early 20th century remains, was removed when the M5 motorway was constructed in the mid-1970s. Since the 1920s, the county has supplied aggregates. Foster Yeoman is Europe's large supplier of limestone aggregates, with quarries at Merehead Quarry. It has a dedicated railway operation, Mendip Rail, which is used to transport aggregates by rail from a group of Mendip quarries.

"What can individuals do to protect the natural resources and unique characteristics of their land with a conservation easement, and how can they get in touch with Potomac Conservancy to learn more? Answer according to: Private lands protected with conservation easements provide a variety of benefits for everyone and everything.
Every meal on our plate and almost all beverages contain ingredients that were grown on a farm. We need land to grow food, and we need healthy soils and clean water to grow crops efficiently for an ever-growing population.
However, poor planning and lack of consideration for saving healthy soils for food production put these agricultural lands at risk of being fragmented and paved over for development.
According to American Farmland Trust, the United States is losing 50 acres of farm and ranchland an hour to sprawl and development.
Since 1993, Potomac Conservancy has been working one-on-one with landowners and partner organizations to preserve private agricultural and forested lands through conservation easements. We work with landowners, like Larry, to implement Best Management Practices (BMPs) on farmlands to improve water quality and restore local streams and creeks.
All of our easements - 72 in total - have forested or naturally vegetated stream banks that filter nutrients, protect against erosion, and keep livestock from entering and polluting waterways.
Would you or someone you know like to leave a legacy by protecting the natural resources, beautiful scenery, and unique characteristics of his or her land with a conservation easement? Or, would you like to learn how you can support private land conservation?

Let MAXPlaces help plan, produce and promote your new web video and expand your reach beyond your current marketing footprint.
A promotional web video will allow you to present a clear, concise message that explains your product or service in an appealing, engaging, and user-friendly format. Information-overloaded Bellevue consumers are much more likely to watch a quick online video than read through a block of boring text. A promotional web video capitalizes on this by putting your product idea into video format for effortless distribution. What it comes down to is that people like to watch stories and respond well to clear, entertaining messages and calls to action.
Similar to a traditional television commercial, a Bellevue promotional web video will allow you to present a clear, concise message that explains your product or service in an appealing, engaging, and user-friendly format.
Just as your website needs to be optimized for maximum Bellevue visibility, so does your video channel. Video descriptions, channel descriptions, playlists and individual videos all allow for targeted keyword optimization.
Google loves video content; they own YouTube after all. However, its not as simple as uploading a video to your Bellevue themed channel and waiting for the views to roll in. There are numerous optimization techniques that must happen before your footage is even uploaded.
A well done web video can go viral and do wonders for your brand or website’s Bellevue presence. We can syndicate your video across hundreds of channels and web media outlets.
Potential Bellevue area customers have been shown to stay longer on websites where video is present. Web videos result in lower bounce rates, higher levels of user engagement and a significant increase in repeat traffic.

"Given the text: This brings us back to the booze. The Ramos Gin Fizz was created in 1888 by Henry C. Ramos at his bar in New Orleans. The amount of shaking required to create the ideal bloom on the drink can range anywhere from 5 to 35 minutes, depending who you ask. Henry C. Ramos had a dozen “shaker boys” behind the bar working around the clock, creating a spectacle and helping to fuel the drink's popularity.
There are a dozen tweaks and preferences amongst bartenders when it comes to making this drink. Should you dry shake first? Add cream last? Strain into a glass from up high? Smaller ice cubes to create smaller bubbles? There’s only one way to find out what works best and that’s to play with the possibilities. Here’s how we did it: Add gin, egg white, lemon and lime juice, simple syrup, and orange flower water to your shaker. (We used bartender-approved Noirot from France for it’s mild and not violently potpourri flavor.) Shake the living crap out of your shaker, for two minutes (or as long as your biceps can handle). Add the cream, a small amount of ice (think 3 small cubes) and shake until well-chilled or the ice has melted. Pour soda water into your glass first, we used Topo Chico, and strain the cocktail over the soda water. Hopefully, your meringue separates from the liquid and your foam rises. If not, it still tastes great and gives you something to aspire to.
1. Add all ingredients except for soda to a cocktail shaker.
2. Shake for two minutes without ice.
3. Add ice and shake until well-chilled or until ice is melted.
4. Pour soda water into glass.
5. Strain drink into Collins glass over soda.

He was followed by others who actually built a church in Lhasa. These included the Jesuit Father Ippolito Desideri, 1716–1721, who gained a deep knowledge of Tibetan culture, language and Buddhism, and various Capuchins in 1707–1711, 1716–1733 and 1741–1745, Christianity was used by some Tibetan monarchs and their courts and the Karmapa sect lamas to counterbalance the influence of the Gelugpa sect in the 17th century until in 1745 when all the missionaries were expelled at the lama's insistence.

Question: Passage: Beer contains ethyl alcohol, the same chemical that is present in wine and distilled spirits and as such, beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol in the human body have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan that the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have penalties against drunk driving.

"Information:  - Digital Underground was an alternative hip hop group from Oakland, California. Their personnel changed and rotated with each album and tour.  - Hip hop is a subcultural art movement that was formed during the early 1970s primarily by African-American and Afro Puerto Rican youths residing in the South Bronx in New York City. Art historian Robert Farris Thompson describes the demographics of the youth that characterize the South Bronx in the early 1970s as ""English-speaking blacks from Barbados"" like Grandmaster Flash, ""black Jamaicans"" like DJ Kool Herc, ""thousands of Nuyoricans"", who introduced the rhythms from Salsa (music), as well as Afro conga and bonga drums, as well as many who emulated the sounds of Tito Puente and Willie Colón with existing styles of musical styles from jazz to funk associated with African Americans prior to the 1970s. Hip hop music became popular outside of the African-American community in the late 1980s. After the rise of new media platforms and Web 2.0 technology of the Internet, fans would primarily consume the musical genre through social networking sites (SNS) beginning with Myspace evolving to notable mobile apps like YouTube, Worldstarhiphop, SoundCloud, and Spotify.  - ""The Humpty Dance"" is a song by Digital Underground, which was featured on their debut album ""Sex Packets"". The single climbed to #11 on the pop charts, #7 on the R&B charts, and #1 on the Billboard Rap Singles chart. The single is sung by Shock G's alter ego, ""Humpty Hump"", marking the character's second musical appearance; the first being Digital Underground's ""Doowutchyalike,"" a pre-album video-single released in the spring of 1989. The song has been sampled by many different artists and producers. In the song's video, a young Tupac Shakur is visible in the background.  - AllMusic (previously known as All Music Guide or AMG) is an online music guide service website. It was launched in 1991 by All Media Guide which later became All Media Network.  - Alternative hip hop (also known as alternative rap) is a subgenre of hip hop music that encompasses the wide range of styles of hip hop that have not become identified as mainstream. AllMusic defines it as follows: ""Alternative rap refers to hip hop groups that tend not to conform to any of the traditional forms of rap, such as gangsta, bass, hardcore, pop, and party rap. Instead, they blur genres  drawing equally from funk and rock, as well as jazz, soul, reggae, country, electronic, and even folk.""  - 2Pacalypse Now is the debut studio album by American rapper 2Pac. It was released on November 12, 1991, by Interscope Records and EastWest Records America. Less polished than it later proceed with his studio album, ""2Pacalypse Now"", which is 2Pac's commentary on contemporary social issues facing American society such as racism, police brutality, poverty, black on black crime, and teenage pregnancy, some issues giving a lyrical glimpse into the world of a young black man on the urban streets of the United States. It featured three singles; ""Brenda's Got a Baby"", ""Trapped"", and ""If My Homie Calls"". ""2Pacalypse Now"" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on April 19, 1995 for sales of 500,000 copies in the United States.  - Raw Fusion was a spin-off project from Digital Underground emcee Money-B, with DJ talent provided by DU contributor DJ Fuze. Their albums contained cameos by many of the Digital Underground crew, including Shock G (as himself, Humpty Hump, and the Piano Man) and 2Pac. The group gave a more raw, hardcore feel than the funky styles that typical Digital Underground albums projected, pulling away from their Funkadelic and Parliament roots. Tracks put out under the Raw Fusion name tended to be more experiemntal and had less of the flow that was typically found in other tracks to which Money-B and DJ Fuze had contributed. The group released two albums before disbanding.  - An alter ego (Latin, ""the other I"") is a second self, which is believed to be distinct from a person's normal or original personality. A person who has an alter ego is said to lead a double life. The term appeared in common usage in the early 19th century when dissociative identity disorder was first described by psychologists. Cicero first coined the term as part of his philosophical construct in 1st century Rome, but he described it as ""a second self, a trusted friend"".  - Gregory Jacobs, commonly known by his stage name Shock G (as well as by his alter ego Humpty Hump) is an American musician and rapper, known as the lead vocalist for the hip hop group Digital Underground.

"Ten people are dead and at least 15 were injured after a rental van mowed down pedestrians in north Toronto on Monday. The van drove south on Yonge Street from Finch Avenue for 2.2 kilometers, leaving a wake of destruction behind it before coming to a stop.
Around 1:30 p.m. Monday, a white van, which had a Ryder Truck Rental and Leasing logo on its side, mounted the sidewalk at the busy intersection of Yonge Street and Finch Avenue and struck a number of people. From there, the van proceeded southbound on Yonge for several blocks toward Sheppard Avenue. Over less than 25 minutes, the van mowed people down in what Toronto’s police chief described as a “deliberate” killing rampage. The van made it roughly 2.2 km before being stopped on the sidewalk near Poyntz Avenue with severe front-end damage.
Toronto police arrested the suspect about 25 minutes after the first police call was made. Once the vehicle stopped, the driver got out and pointed something black at a police officer, pointing it like a handgun and daring the officer to kill him, according to witnesses and videos posted to Twitter. The officer ignored him, advancing slowly toward the suspect, who dropped the object he was holding. No shots were fired in the encounter.
The “horrific and deliberate attack” has left Toronto in mourning, Toronto’s mayor, John Tory, said on Tuesday. It took place around lunchtime on Monday, as crowds were out basking in the sun of one of the first warm days of the year.
With the rise of terrorist attacks in the last year, not only in Canada but also throughout the world, law enforcement is faced with the necessity of a strategy change. The increasingly sophisticated methods of perpetration are outpacing the technical solutions to fight it, making it harder for authorities to distinguish between terrorists and innocents before the terrorists strike. iCognative provides a scientific solution to this fundamental problem in counterterrorism.
For the Toronto police, this investigation can mean a lot of time and money invested in resources to see if there is anyone else connected to this criminal act.
iCognative by Brainwave Science provides an objective, scientific technology to distinguish between terrorists and innocents by detecting the information stored in a terrorist’s brain. In most cases when a terrorism suspect is detained for questioning, he/she is professionally trained to conceal critical information affiliated with his/her networks. It is very costly and time inefficient for investigators to pursue one lead and many times, leads are dropped due to the lack of evidence. In cases of frequent attacks like the ones in Canada, counterterrorism agencies need an efficient solution with a fast response time.
In the Toronto van attack, iCognative can prove to be essential in taking down the entire criminal network and finding out more about their plans or who is part of it. The technology can distinguish between suspects and innocents, by detecting information present in the brain. By building a test setup, the arrested suspect can be can be tested. Alek Minassian, 25, from Richmond Hill, near Toronto, showed little emotion during a brief court appearance on Tuesday. He is our suspect. Any person relevant to the case also can be tested to identify their connection to a crime.
Yonge and Finch is now the site of a huge forensic investigation over a dozen blocks. Toronto police are appealing for people who witnessed the attack to call its investigative hotline and provide any information that could help catch the mastermind behind this horrific act if any. The iCognative test setup only takes about 15 minutes to be built. Any confidential information only known to the perpetrators will be used as input to the system in the form of text or pictures whichever is available to conduct the test on all arrested suspects. In this specific case, according to the media, there are a series of information that can be input into the system as stimuli: for example an image of the specific van, time and date of the attack, Yonge Street, the gun he pulled out confronting the police and any other relevant significant information to perpetrator that will be collected during this crime scene investigation.
During the iCognative test, all these stimuli selected will be displayed on a computer screen to the suspect, while collecting brain responses to each stimulus.

Not only can inbound marketing help attract the right people to your site—the “right people” being those that have the potential to turn into customers—it can generate more online visibility and increase brand awareness.
Your website should be aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly, and full of valuable content. But in addition to all of those beautiful site pages, you also need landing pages. We suggest that you have at least one landing page set up when your site goes live.
Why landing pages? Well, these neat lil’ pages are used to capture visitor information. You direct visitors to these pages to get them to complete a specific action.
Landing pages are essential for lead capture-based businesses. They help you get web visitors into your funnel so you can use lead nurture sequences to eventually turn them into customers.
Blogging is a time commitment and takes effort to maintain, but it’s totally worth it! In order to get started, you’ll need to dedicate either your time (by writing the posts yourself) or money (by hiring writers).
If you’re just starting out and looking for early adopters, use your blog to talk directly to them. Blogging is an opportunity to let those early users know about the progress you’re making, the changes you’re enacting, and how to best use your product or service.
It can be hard to come up with social media fodder when your company is just starting out.

Blogs also make for great opportunities to hone your SEO skills. Optimize every post using SEO best practices and create content that’s both useful and relevant to your target audience. Remember, you want to attract the right people to your site so that eventually your blog readers will become your loyal customers.

"Light pulses penetrate the skin and are absorbed by the melanin present in the hair. The heat produced by the light destroys the hair follicles, causing the hair to fall out. A course of treatments with the Magma will result in hair removal in one of the most effective and pain-free methods available.
Laser Lipo Cavitation with ALW3000.
This innovative technology to offers the most effective and safe hair removal treatments.
The Magma is a precise instrument that can be adjusted to damage only the hair follicle while minimally affecting the surrounding skin. Lasertrolysis is a method of removing unwanted hair, utilizing laser energy targeted to the hair follicle to cause thermal damage and prevent further hairs from growing. The near-infrared laser light is emitted by the ALD applicator and preferentially absorbed by the pigment located in the hair follicle.
The laser is pulsed, or turned on, for only a fraction of a second. The duration of each pulse is just long enough to damage the follicle, while the system’s unique contact-cooling system helps protect the skin by conductive cooling during the laser energy delivery.
The long wavelength penetrates into the hair follicle causing only minimal epidermal injury. Suitable to be used on all skin types.
IPL hair removal is an effective and safe hair removal procedure is achieved as Broad-Light spectrum is applied to the surface of the skin, targeting melanin.
This light travels through the skin until it strikes the hair shafts or the bulb (root) where the highest concentration of melanin is located. As the light is absorbed, the bulb and most of the hair shaft are heated, destroying the hair-producing papilla. Additionally heat conversion occurs directly in the darker capillaries that bring blood to the follicle.
At any one time, not all hair follicles are ‘active’, meaning in Anagen phase and only active hair follicles can be affected by the treatment. ‘Inactive’ hair follicles (e.g. Telogen and catagen) can be treated as they become ‘active’ over time. A series of treatments is required to remove most visible hair.

"Can you summarize the key points from the Ulster vs Dragons match in the Guinness Pro14? Answer according to: Ulster celebrate John Cooney's try.
ULSTER CONTINUED THEIR push for the Guinness Pro14 play-off spots with a vital 28-15 bonus-point victory over the Dragons.
Horrible conditions and a poor Rodney Parade surface meant the game won’t live long in the memory in terms of entertainment, but Dan McFarland’s side still scored four tries.
Ulster – remarkably – lost three men to yellow cards at various stages, but they were comfortable winners as the impressive Jordi Murphy, Marty Moore and John Cooney all scored tries before a crucial late effort from skipper Alan O’Connor.
Ulster ended the first half with 14 men but still 7-3 up.
Dragons lost captain Richard Hibbard in the warm-up and his stand-in as skipper Harrison Keddie to a foot injury, but they did open the scoring through Josh Lewis.
Flying wing Robert Baloucoune was tackled into touch by the covering Jordan Williams as Ulster pushed for a second, but Darren Cave was then yellow carded for an early tackle on Lewis.
A man deficit failed to stop Ulster moving further clear on the game’s resumption with two quick scores. First Moore crashed over after taking a fine line from a Cooney pass.
Then the scrum-half turned from creator to scorer as he pounced for a third Ulster try following a poor kick inside his own 22 by Rhodri Williams of the Dragons.
The final quarter saw plenty of action.
Rob Lyttle and Louis Ludik were both sent to the sin bin for deliberate knock-ons and the Dragons were awarded a penalty try in the second of those instances.
An automatic seven points gave the hosts some respectability, but Ulster were comfortable winners and even with 13 men on the field they were able to crash over for a bonus-point effort via O’Connor.
There was still time late on for the Dragons to grab a late consolation via Basham who was one of their few bright sparks.

The earliest extant arguments that the world of experience is grounded in the mental derive from India and Greece. The Hindu idealists in India and the Greek Neoplatonists gave panentheistic arguments for an all-pervading consciousness as the ground or true nature of reality. In contrast, the Yogācāra school, which arose within Mahayana Buddhism in India in the 4th century CE, based its ""mind-only"" idealism to a greater extent on phenomenological analyses of personal experience. This turn toward the subjective anticipated empiricists such as George Berkeley, who revived idealism in 18th-century Europe by employing skeptical arguments against materialism.

These views on religious tolerance and the importance of individual conscience, along with the social contract, became particularly influential in the American colonies and the drafting of the United States Constitution. Thomas Jefferson called for a ""wall of separation between church and state"" at the federal level. He previously had supported successful efforts to disestablish the Church of England in Virginia, and authored the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. Jefferson's political ideals were greatly influenced by the writings of John Locke, Francis Bacon, and Isaac Newton whom he considered the three greatest men that ever lived.

Health systems in the Rock River Valley have gone the route of opening their own convenient/immediate/prompt care clinics inside physicians’ offices, which they deem more affordable and reliable.
Local hospitals are staying closer to home to improve access to health care rather than partner with retail outlets and open convenient-care clinics in grocery stores and shopping malls.
Across the country, patients are seeking medical treatment for sore throats, ear infections and other ailments at clinics housed in Wal-Mart Supercenters and Walgreens pharmacies. Such retail locales usually stay open later and offer weekend hours for people who can’t see a doctor during regular business hours.
Health systems in the Rock River Valley have gone the route of opening their own convenient/immediate/prompt care clinics inside physicians’ offices, which they deem more affordable and reliable. That keeps patients closer to the systems for follow-up care while still providing later hours.
But hospital officials aren’t ruling out the possibility of partnering with retail outlets down the road.
“We’re sticking with what we have now, but that doesn’t mean we’ll never look at it again,” said Don Daniels, vice president of medical group management for SwedishAmerican Health System.
Both SwedishAmerican and Rockford Health System talked to Wal-Mart officials about building clinics inside their stores within the last two or three years.
“The decision we made rather than go into those (retail) institutions was to make ourselves more available with a broader scope of services,” said John Rhoades, chief operating officer of Rockford Health Physicians, a subsidiary of Rockford Health System.
Rockford Health Physicians has three convenient care locations, and Rhoades said they’re considering a fourth.
Hospital convenient-care clinics are typically staffed with physicians and nurses, while retail outlets often rely on licensed nurse practitioners. Patients haven’t necessarily cared about that difference at the TakeCare Health Clinics inside local Walgreens stores, company officials said.
The Rock River Valley has four TakeCare locations that have maintained consistent business since the first one opened nearly a year ago, said Wendy Edwards, the lead TakeCare nurse practitioner for the Rockford area.
“We’ve had a lot of compliments from people who are just happy to have us as an option,” Edwards said.
TakeCare clinics canvass the region to see which physicians are accepting new patients so they can refer their patients for follow-up care. In some cases, they will call on behalf of patients for necessary appointments.

"How can we address potential risks associated with genetic engineering? Can you provide an example of how genetic engineering could result in unintended consequences that may pose a threat to a large number of people? And how can we mitigate these risks to ensure the safety of the affected population?
In terms of potential risks, one example could be the unintentional creation of a superbug through genetic modification of bacteria. This could have devastating effects on public health if it were to spread uncontrollably.
To mitigate such risks, we can establish strict regulations and guidelines for genetic engineering research and ensure that all experiments are conducted in contained environments. Additionally, we can implement measures to monitor and detect any potential risks early on, such as regular testing of modified organisms for any unexpected behaviors or mutations. Finally, open communication and collaboration between researchers, regulators, and the public can help ensure transparency and accountability in the field of genetic engineering. 
As for Go code, we could implement monitoring systems using Go code to detect any unexpected behaviors or mutations in modified organisms. For example:
package main
import (
    ""fmt""
    ""log""
    ""os/exec""
)
func main() {
    // Run a test on a modified organism

"What is a one-sentence summary of the following article?
Depending on how tall the child is, get down onto your knees or sit on the floor to talk with them. Eye contact is super important for communication, and if you are towering over them, they probably can’t see your eyes or facial expressions very well.   If it’s hard for you to kneel or sit on the hard floor, try bringing a chair over to where they are. If you’re trying to talk about something serious that the child might be avoiding, ask them to make eye contact with you. If after you ask them to make eye contact and they still won’t, consider coming back to the conversation later or have the conversation while they are looking away from you. If they use a doll or stuffed animal to talk through, talk back to that toy. If they start telling you about how they went to the moon recently, ask them to tell you more about what they did there. Imagination and playing make-believe is a big part of creativity, so play along! Don’t correct them if they tell you something you know isn’t true, like that the middle of the earth is made of cheese. Just go with it—you might even have more fun than you imagined! “Would You Rather” is a fun game to play with kids, as is “I Spy.” You could even build something with them out of LEGOs or do a puzzle with them. Doing an activity together provides a backdrop for communication and connection.  Make sure to keep questions and games kid-friendly! For older children, you may want to learn (or ask them to teach you) how to play their favorite video games or games on the phone. They also might like to learn more advanced board games, like Monopoly or Clue. It’s okay to tell a child that you don’t like a particular activity (chances are they would tell you if they were bored or didn’t want to do something). Ask if there is something else they would like to do, or make a suggestion for a different activity you could do together. In the end, be open to making compromises, and perhaps set a time limit for how long you will do a certain activity.  Be honest and say something like, “I don’t enjoy playing with Play-Doh because it makes my hands smell funny. Could we color together instead?” For older children, ask them to explain to you why they like an activity so much. It might just spark an interest in you, too! Even if it’s not a new toy from the store, just bringing something that they don’t normally play with is a fun and exciting thing! Younger children might like colored pencils, construction paper, stuffed animals, puppets, or small puzzles—things you may already have around the house that you could toss into a bag to bring with you. For older children, bring new books or puzzles.  If this is a child you see regularly, like a niece or nephew, try to always have something new in your bag. That way, every time you show up, they will be excited to see what new kinds of activities you brought along! If you are a babysitter, consider creating a babysitting bag. Pretend like you are going to take a nap but want a “bed-time story” first. Lay down on the floor with a pillow and ask them to tell you a story. They can read to you from a book if they are old enough, or they could re-tell one of their favorite stories, or make up a new one of their own! Or, tell them a story—either one you have made up or you could let them pick out a book for you to read to them. Another fun option is to have them tell you a story and you write it down for them. Then, you can talk about it and even draw pictures about it together later.",ultrafeedback,good,646,False

Q: In response to the weakening of the original fugitive slave act, the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 penalized officials who did not arrest an alleged runaway slave, and made them liable to a fine of $1,000 (about $29,000 in present-day value). Law-enforcement officials everywhere were required to arrest people suspected of being a runaway slave on as little as a claimant's sworn testimony of ownership. The suspected slave could not ask for a jury trial or testify on his or her own behalf. In addition, any person aiding a runaway slave by providing food or shelter was subject to six months' imprisonment and a $1,000 fine.

"The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a $1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides $1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the $25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

The conversation and the options are separated by a newline character. Each dialogue in the conversation are separated by a comma. F and M indicate female and male, respectively.

M: Excuse me. How much is this suit? ,F: It's on sale today for $750. It's normally $900. ,M: Wow, that is pretty expensive! I was thinking that it might be 4 or 500. ,F: This material is imported from Italy. It's the finest in the world, and if you bought a suit made of this material at many department stores, you would pay about $2000. ,M: Uh-hah. But isn't that the point of coming to a market like this, to get a discount compared to the expensive department stores? Besides I saw a suit just like this one a few stalls down, and they were selling it for $600. I still thought that it was too expensive. ,F: It's possible that the suit you saw was the same color is this one but made of a different material. Unfortunately, our prices are final, and we think there are the lowest anywhere in the city.
(A) M: Okay, I'll buy it at the price you want. Here, it's $600. (B) M: Just a minute! I do not quite follow what you are saying, would you mind repeating that? (C) M: Although the material is imported from France, it is not worth the $750 you want. (D) M: You want $900 for the suit? It's too expensive!
Solution: B
Why? Options (A) and (B) are not corrct because the suit's price is 900. Option (C) isn't correct because the material was imported from italy.

You have to infer the answer to the question from the review and classify it. Classify the reviewer's sentiment into: ""no sentiment expressed"", ""negative"", ""neutral"", ""positive"", and ""mixed"". The mixed category indicates reviews where none of the sentiments are dominant (mix of positive and negative, or borderline cases); hence it is hard to detect the primary sentiment. Also, assign neutral label to reviews that express no clear sentiment toward an entity or any aspect of it. The ""no sentiment expressed"" label should be assigned to the reviews where the given aspect didn't discuss in the text.

"Could you explain how the competition dynamics in pattern formation on biological membranes can be analyzed by initialization with potential pattern-forming nuclei, and how the location of the steady state domains is not solely determined by the curvature, which might have advantages biologically?: We study by computer simulations the physics of domain formation on surfaces, as a model for pattern formation on biological membranes. We compare the dynamics predicted by a simple phase separation model for a binary mixture, with that obtained through a conserved Turing-like reaction-diffusion model. Both types of models have been proposed as frameworks for understanding the formation of domains in biological systems. Our main result is that the models can be qualitatively distinguished by analysing the competition dynamics which is set when initialising the system with a number of potential pattern-forming nuclei. Our simulations also suggest that the location of the steady state domains is not uniquely determined by the curvature. This lack of curvature dependence might be advantageous biologically, as it disentangles pattern formation from the mechanics and morphology of the cell membranes.

"Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not. The claim asks if the posts are historical or hypothetical. The posts are ""HISTORICAL"" when the author has already done something and they are ""HYPOTHETICAL"" when the author is considering doing something in the future. Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no'

Example input: CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : Background: I have ocd and the only contamination issue I have is around food. Both parents know this. What has lead me to ask this question is this mornings reaction from parent B.

This morning parent b offered to make me breakfast, I responded how I always do: that’s very kind but I’m happy to come make it myself. Parent b said it was no trouble. I accepted. Two slices of toast came and apu I check the toast for signs of mould. First piece had no issues, I ate it. Second piece however had something green growing on the edge. I cut this bit off but I couldn’t shake in my head that the whole piece must be contaminated and so I took the toast back and apologised that I couldn’t eat it cos of the mould and we checked the date on the bread and it said the 30th December. Nearly a week past its best before. Parent b apologised and we threw it away. No drama.

Nearly identical situation occurred about 6 months ago with parent a. Parent a offered to make me a toasted sandwich. I said that would be very kind but I was happy to make it myself. Parent a said it was no problem, I accepted. When the sandwich came I checked the bread for mould and found green and white stuff growing down one side of the bread. I take it back to the kitchen and explain that it has mould and I’m sorry but I can’t eat it. I will make myself something else. Parent a goes ballistic. I’m “ungrateful and don’t trust them and did I really think they’d feed me mould?” I pointed out the mould- clearly visible. “Well someone must’ve not sealed the bread package properly (ie me) and that’s how it got mouldy.” I asked if parent a had checked the date and that just seemed to escalate their reaction. They stormed out screaming and crying. I checked the bread date and it was 2 or 3 days past the best before.

Aita in either situation? Parent a’s reaction made me think I was. But now I’ve had the same situation with parent b and they didn’t get angry or pissed off maybe I wasn’t the asshole? Obviously I think I need to just make my own food. Then I can’t cause trouble.
Example output: yes
Example explanation: The post clearly mentions an event in the past when the author asked some questions to his/her parents and also describes about their reactions on that day. Hence this should be HISTORICAL.
Q: CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : Some info: he’s fucking horrible with money. He’s worked okay jobs for 8 years now, shares an apartment with our dad which means his rent is low but he uses all his money on unhealthy foods and goods and technology and games. He has no savings, has had a wreck of a credit score once or twice plus an addiction or two. For the past year though he’s been on a path for better life style and priorities. 

I have worked more than 3 years a minimum wage job and have roughly 3000 in savings, I manage my expenses well and even have the money to have some fun yet these days I can manage to save up to 400euros a month. 

Now the situation: to get a promotion he would need a drivers license. Getting one here would mount up to 1050-1500euros all together and as I said he has no savings. He asked if I could lend him the money and he’d pay back all of it plus 300euros interest, each a month in 150euro payments. 

I’ve loaned him money before (last time was end of last month) and sometimes he comes through with the promised repayment schedule, sometimes he attempts to get around it claiming he’d already paid me all he owes me which leads to arguments and threats of me telling everyone what he did. 

A thousand euros is a lot of money. Along with all that I might leave for university in autumn which means I would like to have savings as a fallback should I not find a part time job along with studies and just to feel safe.  A part of me wants to help him and if he doesn’t pay my mom is prepared to give him hell for it but I’m scared. 

I told him I would think about it but I fear he will become emotionally abusive (he’s been like it before) if I don’t help him because “I’m doing so much better than him”. Fyi, he gets paid more than I do, he’s just stupid and doesn’t save money. 

I love him but I have very big trust issues even with myself when it comes to money. I fear that his payments will slow down or stop and for my future’s sake I can’t afford it. But 3000euros is already a lot of money considering I have a steady income, and he could really use this in order to boost his income and status at work.

"Is this essay grammatically correct:
""My face contorted. Beads of sweat trickled down my neck as the intense spicy taste of the central-style braised fish spread from my tongue to my throat. I grabbed some rice and shoved it into my mouth. Five rice chopsticks for a slice of fish. I kept eating like that until I finished my rice bowl, practically without touching the fish dish. I believed myself to have “escaped” since my family would have “hu tieu,” a Southern-style dish, the next day.
Such was my attitude to family dinners when I was younger. At that time, I thought having a multicultural family was challenging. The situation became much more difficult when I had to cook. On Vietnam’s food map, my grandparents are the harmonious “bun cha Hanoi,” my parents are the spicy “bun bo Hue,” while my brother and I are the sweet “com tam Saigon.” To suit the preferences of my family members, I had to rotate between food from the north, central, and south areas every day. However, people always avoided dishes that did not fit their region’s tastes. Even I could only enjoy one out of three meals I prepared. My cooking efforts appeared to be worthless.
One day, a fascinating idea struck me: blending regional flavors. As a result, a northern dish with rich sweetness and intense spiciness was prepared for dinner. To my surprise, everyone shook their heads in disdain. I even had to admit that it was a failure. Even though the dish had a variety of tastes, it was inferior to regional specialties. And my attempt to combine cuisine quickly failed.
I return to the previous method, albeit with a few changes. Instead of rotating meals daily, each dinner now includes dishes from all three regions: northern, central, and southern Vietnam. Everyone is more eager to eat than before since everyone has a dish that suits their taste. I also gradually become fascinated by the unique flavors of each region’s cuisine. Those differences, when combined, can create a meal that harmonizes everyone’s tastes. And it is my role as a cook to highlight those distinctions so that each dish shines in its own way.
Rice University is, in various ways, similar to my family. The residential colleges are mini colleges with their own traditions and cultures within the entire university, like my family members with their own palates from each region of Vietnam. During the “Ask Me Anything with Rice Students” event, I heard students explain why their residential college is the best while praising the distinctiveness of others. This combination of confidence and mutual respect reminded me of family dinners. And while hearing about each servery’s special food, such as Chef Roger’s cinnamon rolls in the West Servery or Asian meals from the “Wok on Sunset” station in the North Servery, I thought Rice needed more Vietnamese dishes. My family dinners taught me to value uniqueness, and I would love to share southern Vietnamese cuisine with Rice University.""",ultrafeedback,good,741,False

"What do you think about this?

The setting is supposed to focus more on smaller communities, that live together in a village-like structure. Relationships are often very long and personal and include intimacy to a greater level than our current society. Monogamy is a very rare exception rather than the norm. Kids are often raised by multiple people and 'parents' would not be considered an imporant entity. Assisted suicide is also legal and available for everyone living there after fulfilling a few requirements.

C is the main character of the entire story and most parts are told from her perspective. She acts as a link between Elena and Alex and is always trying to keep the community together, slowly growing into the role of a leader.
Elena is the newest addition to the community. She came from outside and isnt fully used to the differeces yet. She quickly fell in love with C and almost treats her like a big sister that she can always rely on.
Alex is struggling especially hard, since his partner Anna had no terminal illness and chose to end her life purely for philosophical reason. They were the one exception in the community when they met each other and only had interest for themselves and didnt need other sexual partners. 

A first chapter could look like this, focussing on Elena and C first: 
'Do you really need to go already?', she asked as she looked at C with big eyes. She knew, that C wouldn't stay the night with her and she understood it as well. 'Pleeease, just a few more minutes' the begging continued she grinned after squinting and catching her the smile that she was unable to withhold. C allowed herself to get pulled back by Elena one last time and hugged her back. Giving her this kind of hug. That let her know she was leaving. Now. That this was the last one. C unraveled herself, leaned back, and looked at her one more time. Smiled and then gave her the final kiss on the forehead. 'Stay safe my little dragon. I hope you can make it for a few hours without me.' Elena tried to pout but when she saw that C could barely hold her laugh back she just went with the best dragon impression she could give: 'Rooaaarr' - both of them bursted out lauging until C finally stood up and turned around. She wouldn't turn back. 'Once she made a choice she always go with it.', Elena thought. No turning around, no regrets.

"John Lewis formalwear buyer Carsten Skovgaard is stepping down after almost five years at the retailer.
He will leave in April, and it is not yet known who his replacement will be or what his plans are.
Skovgaard took on the formalwear buyer position in October last year, after spending the previous four-and-a-half-years as branded menswear buyer at the department store chain. Before joining John Lewis he worked at Harrods for 11 years as a menswear buyer.
A manager at one menswear brand stocked by John Lewis described Skovgaard as “very well respected” in the industry. “Wherever he goes he will do great things. He has totally changed branded menswear at John Lewis,” he said.
During his time at the retailer Skovgaard introduced new labels in store including men’s casualwear brand Grayers, and updated the online offer with brands including Merc and Farhi by Nicole Farhi.
Meanwhile, it emerged late last week that John Lewis is making 325 department manager roles redundant.
Each branch has about 10 department managers, who are due to be replaced by one or two more senior managers in 28 of the retailer’s 40 stores.
John Lewis is to relocate a key distribution centre from west London to Milton Keynes putting 560 staff under consultation.
John Lewis is to make returning products substantially easier after signing a partnership with courier CollectPlus.
Fashion sales at John Lewis grew 2% last week as menswear and sportswear shot up 10.5%.

One example: Abstract: This study was designed to determine the influence of a long-term, moderate-intensity treadmill training program on the distribution of blood flow within and among muscles of rats during exercise. One group (T) of male Sprague-Dawley rats trained for 1 h/day for 13-17 wk at 30 m/min on a motor-driven treadmill. A second group (UT) of rats was conditioned for 10 min/day for 4 wk at the same speed. Muscle succinate dehydrogenase activities were higher in T than UT rats indicating a significant training effect. Blood flows (BFs) in 32 hindlimb muscles or muscle parts and other selected organs were measured in the two groups with radiolabeled microspheres during preexercise and while the rats ran for 30 s, 5 min, or 15 min at 30 m/min on the treadmill. The data indicate 1) there were no differences in total hindlimb muscle BF between UT and T rats at any time; however, 2) T rats had higher preexercise heart rates and higher muscle BFs in the deep red extensor muscles, suggesting a greater anticipatory response to the impending exercise; 3) T rats demonstrated more rapid elevations in BF in the red extensor muscles at the commencement of exercise; 4) T rats had higher BFs in red extensor muscles during exercise, whereas UT rats had higher BFs in white muscles; and 5) T rats maintained higher BFs in the visceral organs during exercise. These findings demonstrate that exercise training results in changes in the distribution of BF within and among muscles and among organs during exercise. Specifically, data indicate the high-oxidative motor units that are primarily recruited in the muscles during the initial stages of moderate treadmill exercise receive higher blood flows in the trained rats; this presumably contributes to increased resistance to fatigue.. Title: Exercise blood flow patterns within and among rat muscles after training.
Solution is here: yes
Explanation: Title is appropriate for the given abstract because the focus of this abstract is cerebral white matter assesment.

Now, solve this: Abstract: In order to elucidate energy balance in the skeletal muscle, we cloned cDNA of a homologue of uncoupling protein (UCP) from rat skeletal muscle. We also cloned rat UCP-2 cDNA from rat brown adipose tissue (BAT). The UCP cloned from rat skeletal muscle showed 57% and 72% identity with rat UCP-1 and UCP-2. The mRNA was expressed abundantly in the skeletal muscle, moderately in the BAT, and slightly in the white adipose tissue (WAT) with a major band at 2.5 kb and a minor band at 2.8 kb, while the UCP-2 gene expression was widely detected in the whole body with substantial levels in the WAT and with slight levels in the skeletal muscle and BAT. The rat UCP cloned in the present study showed 86% identity with the recently cloned human UCP-3, which was also expressed abundantly in the skeletal muscle with a signal of 2.4 kb. Therefore, the rat UCP was considered to be rat UCP-3. In rats fed high-fat diet the UCP-3 gene expression was augmented 2-fold in the skeletal muscle while UCP-2 mRNA levels were increased significantly (1.6-fold) in the epididymal WAT. Augmented expression of UCPs may provide defense against high-fat induced obesity and impairment of glucose metabolism..

"Can you explain what the symbols in this section mean:

The Telephone Theorem

An early result in the natural abstractions agenda was the telephone theorem, which was proven before the framework settled on redundant information. In this theorem, the abstractions are defined as limits of minimal sufficient statistics along a Markov chain, which we now explain in more detail:

A sufficient statistic of a random variable 

\(Y\)

 for the purpose of predicting 

\(X\)

 is, roughly speaking, a function 

\(f(Y)\)

 that contains all the available information for predicting 

\(X\)

:

\[P(X \mid Y) = P\big(X \mid f(Y)\big).\]

If 

\(X\)

 and 

\(Y\)

 are variables in the universe and very ""distant"" from each other, then there is usually not much predictable information available, which means that 

\(\)

\(f(Y)\)

 can be ""small"" and might be thought of as an ""abstraction"". 

Now, the telephone theorem describes how these summary statistics behave along a Markov chain when chosen to be ""minimal"". For more details, especially about the proof, see the accompanying pdf. 

Theorem (The telephone theorem). For any Markov chain 

\(X\_0 \to X\_1 \to \dots\)

 of random variables 

\(X\_t: \Omega \to \mathcal{X}\_i\)

 that are either discrete or absolutely continuous, there exists a sequence of measurable functions 

\(f\_1, f\_2, ...\)

, where 

\(f\_t: \mathcal{X}\_i \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{X\_0(\Omega)}\)

, such that:

\(f\_t(X\_t)\)

 converges in probability to some random variable 

\(f\_\infty\)

, and 
for all 

\(t, P(X\_0 \mid X\_t) = P\big(X\_0 \mid f\_t(X\_t)\big)\)

 pointwise on 

\(\Omega\)

 (so 

\(f\_t(X\_t)\)

 is a sufficient statistic of 

\(X\_t\)

 for the purpose of predicting 

\(X\_0\)

). 

Concretely, we can pick 

\(f\_t(X\_t) := P(X\_0 \mid X\_t)\)

 as the minimal sufficient statistic.

Proof sketch. 

\(f\_t(X\_t) := P(X\_0 \mid X\_t)\)

 can be viewed as a random variable on 

\(\Omega\)

 mapping 

\(\omega \in \Omega\)

 to the conditional probability distribution 

\[P\big(X\_0 \mid X\_t = X\_t(\omega)\big) \in \mathbb{R}^{X\_0(\Omega)}.\]

Then clearly, this satisfies the second property: if you know how to predict 

\(X\_0\)

 from the (unknown) 

\(X\_t(\omega)\)

, then you do just as well in predicting 

\(X\_0\)

 as if you know 

\(X\_t(\omega)\)

 itself:

\[P\big(X\_0 \mid X\_t(\omega)\big) = P\Big(X\_0 \mid P\big(X\_0 \mid X\_t = X\_t(\omega)\big)\Big) = P\big(X\_0 \mid f\_t(X\_t) = f\_t(X\_t(\omega))\big)\]

For the first property, note that the mutual information 

\(I(X\_0; X\_t)\)

 decreases across the Markov chain, but is also bounded from below by 

\(0\)

 and thus eventually converges to a limit information 

\(I\_{\infty}\)

. Thus, for any 

\(\epsilon > 0\)

, we can find a 

\(T\)

 such that for all 

\(t \geq T\)

 and 

\(k \geq 0\)

 the differences in mutual information are bounded by 

\(\epsilon\)

:

\[\epsilon > \left| I(X\_0; X\_t) - I(X\_0; X\_{t+k}) \right| = |I(X\_0; X\_t,X\_{t+k}) - I(X\_0; X\_{t+k})| = \\ |I(X\_0; X\_t \mid X\_{t+k})|.\]

In the second step, we used that 

\(X\_0 \to X\_t \to X\_{t+k}\)

 forms a Markov chain, and the final step is the chain rule of mutual information. Now, the latter mutual information is just a KL divergence:

\[D\_{KL}\Big( P(X\_0, X\_t \mid X\_{t+k} ) \ \| \ P(X\_0 \mid X\_{t+k}) \cdot P(X\_t \mid X\_{t+k})\Big) < \epsilon.\]

Thus, ""approximately"" (with the detailed arguments involving the correspondence between KL divergence and total variation distance) we have the following independence:

\[P(X\_0, X\_t \mid X\_{t+k}) \approx P(X\_0 \mid X\_{t+k}) \cdot P(X\_t \mid X\_{t+k}).\]

\(\)

By the chain rule, we can also decompose the left conditional in a different way:

\[P(X\_0, X\_t \mid X\_{t+k}) = P(X\_0 \mid X\_t, X\_{t+k}) \cdot P(X\_t \mid X\_{t+k}) = P(X\_0 \mid X\_t) \cdot P(X\_t \mid X\_{t+k}),\]

where we have again used the Markov chain 

\(X\_0 \to X\_t \to X\_{t+k}\)

 in the last step. Equating the two expansions of the conditional and dividing by 

\(P(X\_t \mid X\_{t+k})\)

, we obtain

\[f\_t(X\_t) = P(X\_0 \mid X\_t) \approx P(X\_0 \mid X\_{t+k}) = f\_{t+k}(X\_{t+k}).\]

By being careful about the precise meaning of these approximations, one can then show that the sequence 

\(f\_t(X\_t)\)

 indeed converges in probability.

Dutch chip equipment maker ASML's CEO questions US export rules on China -newspaper 
AMSTERDAM :The chief executive of ASML Holding NV, the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker, on Tuesday questioned whether a U.S. push to get the Netherlands to adopt new rules restricting exports to China make sense.

""Maybe they think we should come across the table, but ASML has already sacrificed,"" CEO Peter Wennink said in an interview with newspaper NRC Handelsblad.

He said that following U.S. pressure, the Dutch government has already restricted ASML from exporting its most advanced lithography machines to China since 2019, something he said has benefited U.S. companies selling alternative technology.

He said that while 15 per cent of ASML's sales are in China, at U.S. chip equipment suppliers ""it is 25 or sometimes more than 30 per cent"".

A spokesperson for ASML confirmed the remarks in the interview were accurate but declined further comment.

The Biden administration issued new export rules for U.S. companies in October aimed at cutting off China's ability to manufacture advanced semiconductor chips in a bid to slow its military and technological advances.

Washington is urging the Netherlands, Japan and other unspecified countries with companies that make cutting edge manufacturing equipment to adopt similar rules. The Dutch trade minister has confirmed talks are ongoing.

Wennink said it seemed contradictory that U.S. chip manufacturers are able to sell their most advanced chips to Chinese customers, while ASML is only able to sell older chipmaking equipment.
""American chip manufacturers have no problem with China as a customer,"" he said.
Meanwhile, ""it is common knowledge that chip technology for purely military applications is usually 10, 15 years old. (Yet) the technology used to make such chips can still be sold to China,"" he added.",ultrafeedback,good,816,False

Q: Thadeous and Fabious are sons of King Tallious in the Kingdom of Mourne. They are warriors: Fabious is dashing and skilled and Thadeous is lazy and ineffectual. While celebrating his latest victory over the evil sorcerer, Leezar, who has been ravaging Tallious's kingdom, Fabious introduces the virgin Belladonna whom he has freed from a tower and wishes to marry. Though his brother makes him the best man, Thadeous skips the wedding after overhearing Fabious's Knights Elite, led by Boremont, talk about him negatively. The wedding is then crashed by Leezar, who reveals himself to be the one who placed Belladonna in the tower. Leezar re-kidnaps her and flees. Returning to the castle with his servant Courtney, Thadeous is given an ultimatum: join Fabious on his quest to rescue Belladonna or be banished from Mourne.Visiting the Great Wize Wizard, Thadeous and Fabious learn that Leezar is attempting to fulfill a prophecy of a warlock having sex with a maiden when the two moons converge, impregnating her with a dragon that will allow him to take over King Tallious's kingdom. To destroy Leezar, they are given a magic compass that will lead them to the Blade of Unicorn, located within a labyrinth. On the way there, they learn Fabious's eunuch slave, Julie, has been reporting to Leezar of their progress and that the Knights Elite are serving the warlock. Fabious sends his mechanical bird Simon to tell the king of the betrayal by the Knights Elite and request reinforcements. Thadeous, Fabious and Courtney are captured by nymphs under their leader, Marteetee, who imprisons them at an arena, where Fabious kills off Marteetee's finest warrior. In retaliation, Marteetee summons a hydra-like monster to kill them. The brothers are rescued by Isabel, a warrior seeking revenge for her father's murder at Marteetee's hands.Later that night, Thadeous learns that Isabel is also after Leezar for the slaughter of her brothers. The next day, the party learns too late that Isabel stole the compass from Thadeous. Fabious, finally angered by his brother's selfishness, decides to find the Blade of Unicorn alone as Thadeous and Courtney go to a tavern, where they find Isabel and steal the compass back. But finding that his brother has been captured by Leezar's men, Thadeous wins Isabel over as they join forces, entering the labyrinth where they encounter a Minotaur. After becoming separated from the others, Thadeous retrieves the Blade of Unicorn and slays the Minotaur. Thadeous and his group make their way to Leezar's castle and free Fabious, giving him the Sword of Unicorn. As the others kill off Julie, Boremont's men and Leezar's three witches, Fabious impales Leezar with the Blade of Unicorn, to prevent him from raping Belladonna.After their victory, Isabel leaves for another quest and the heroes return home. Fabious and Belladonna marry, while Thadeous is approached by Isabel, who reveals that she has fallen in love with him. However, for them to have sex, he must first slay the witch who has cast a spell on her, locking her in a chastity belt.

"you are one of the smartest prompt creator in the world for generative AIs.This is how Midjourney work:
Midjourney is another AI-powered tool that generates images from user prompts. MidJourney is proficient at adapting actual art styles to create an
image of any combination of things the user wants. It excels at creating environments, especially fantasy and sci-fi scenes, with dramatic lighting
that looks like rendered concept art from a video game. How does Midjourney work?
Midjourney is an AI image generation tool that takes inputs through text prompts and parameters and uses a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm
trained on a large amount of image data to produce unique images. is powered by Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), a cutting-edge text-to-image
synthesis technique. Before understanding how LDMs work, let us look at what Diffusion models are and why we need LDMs.
Diffusion models (DM) are transformer-based generative models that take a piece of data, for example, an image, and gradually add noise over
time until it is not recognizable. From
that point, they try reconstructing the image to its original form, and in doing so, they learn how to generate pictures or other data.
The issue with DMs is that the powerful ones often consume hundreds of GPU days, and inference is quite expensive due to sequential
evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources without compromising their quality as well as flexibility, DMs are applied in
the latent space of powerful pre-trained autoencoders.
Training a diffusion model on such a representation makes it possible to achieve an optimal point between complexity reduction and detail
preservation, significantly improving visual fidelity. Introducing a cross-attention layer to the model architecture turns the diffusion model into a
powerful and flexible generator for generally conditioned inputs such as text and bounding boxes, enabling high-resolution convolution-based
synthesis.
Version
Light
Midjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency, coherency, and quality. The latest model is the default, but other models
can be used using the --version or --v parameter or by using the /settings command and selecting a model version. Different models excel at
different types of images. Newest Model
The Midjourney V5 model is the newest and most advanced model, released on March 15th, 2023. To use this model, add the --v 5 parameter to
the end of a prompt, or use the /settings command and select MJ Version 5
This model has very high Coherency, excels at interpreting natural language prompts, is higher resolution, and supports advanced features like
repeating patterns with --tile To turn it on type --v 5 after your prompt or select ""V5"" from /settings
What's new with the V5 base model?
- Much wider stylistic range and more responsive to prompting
- Much higher image quality (2x resolution increase) improved dynamic range
- More detailed images. Details more likely to be correct. Less unwanted text.
- Improved performance with image prompting
- Supports --tile argument for seamless tiling (experimental)
- Supports --ar aspect ratios greater than 2:1 (experimental)
- Supports --iw for weighing image prompts versus text prompts
Style and prompting for V5
- Today’s test is basically a ‘pro’ mode of the model.
- It’s MUCH more ‘unopinionated’ than v3 and v4, and is tuned to provide a wide diversity of outputs and to be very responsive to your inputs.
- The tradeoff here is that it may be harder to use. Short prompts may not work as well. You should try to write longer, more explicit text about
what you want (ie: “cinematic photo with dramatic lighting”)
- Please chat with each other in prompt-chat to figure out how to use v5.
- We hope to have a ‘friendly’ default styling for v5 before we switch it to default. When this happens we will still let you turn it off and get back to
something like this ‘raw’ mode today.
Please note
- This is an alpha test and things will change. DO NOT rely on this exact model being available in the future. It will be significantly modified as we
take V5 to full release.
- Right now there is no V5 upsampler, the default resolution of V5 is the same as upscaled V4. If you click upscale it will just instantly give you that
one image by itself.
Community Standards:
- This model can generate much more realistic imagery than anything we've released before.
- We’ve increased the number of moderators, improved moderation tooling, and will be enforcing our community standards with increased
strictness and rigor. Don't be a jerk or create images to cause drama.
More about V5:
V5 is our second model trained on our AI supercluster and has been in the works for 5 months. It uses significantly different neural architectures
and new aesthetic techniques. V5 isn't the final step, but we hope you all feel the progression of something deep and unfathomable in the power
of our collective human imagination.

6.) The main goal of this novel series is to show readers that balance is important. And that nothing is ever just good or evil. As well as how powerful perspective is.
7.) I would like the Specters to be a physical representation of a person's true self. And the magic system I provided is meant to allow humans to become more powerful when their specter and themselves align.
8.) Show readers how to: A.) have meaningful conversations and B.) what healthy and unhealthy relationships look like. C.) different relationships affect you and the people around

Here is the Premise of the Novel:
""Specter Ark"" is a multi-POV fantasy novel series set in a nonlinear, third-person limited narrative. In this world, a meteor crash introduced magic energy, enabling humans to summon Supernatural beings and mythical creatures called Specters. As the meteor's energy dwindled, a shaman crafted the Specter Ark to preserve 37 powerful Specters. Centuries later, archaeologists accidentally release these spirit-like Specters, who can now only interact with the world when manifested by humans whose values align with their own.
In this novel, the journeys of 20 main characters are intertwined: 10 Specters and the 10 humans who can manifest them. Each pair, driven by unique motivations and desires, must collaborate to achieve their goals. Throughout their adventures, they encounter the remaining 27 Specters and their respective human partners, revealing the impact of this rediscovered magic on the world around them.

Here are the Rules and limitations of the magic system:
Humans can perform a birthday ritual to detect or attract Specters, which are invisible and cannot interact until the ritual is performed. Specters can only be seen by their attached human or when physically manifested. Once attached, Specters cannot attach to another human or be seen by other Specters. The human feels the Specter's pain, and the Specter dies if the human does, unless the bond is released. Specters have free will and may not align with human desires, despite being able to manifest and dismiss at will.
Specters' abilities are tied to their values and personality. Alignment between the two strengthens the abilities. Developing new values or traits can lead to the gain or loss of abilities. Additionally, the specter's growing abilities can influence their human personality and values, leading to changes such as becoming overly protective towards those who don't align with their values.
Specters can only use their abilities when physically manifested for a limited duration, determined by the bond strength between humans and Specter. Manifestation is restricted to once every 24 hours and requires concentration. Overuse depletes energy, causing damage and requiring rest. Distraction or emotional state can hinder manifestation. Energy depletion can lead to physical exhaustion or death. Powerful abilities consume more energy.
Divergence in values can prevent a human from manifesting their specter physically, and prolonged absence can result in Specter influence, leading to possession. A mutual pact between a possessed human and a Specter creates one entity with the Specter as a voice in the human's mind. The pact cannot be broken without both dying. Forced possession allows Specter control, but the human can fight back, with success resulting in Specter's death and mental health consequences for the human.

One example: In a letter posted on the White House web site Tuesday  John Brennan  assistant to President Barack Obama for homeland security and counterterrorism  said Schmidt will have regular access to the president and play a vital role in the country's security.
 Schmidt's selection comes more than 10 months after Obama declared cyber security a priority and ordered a broad administration review.
 A senior White House official said Obama was personally involved in the selection process and chose Schmidt because of his unique background and skills. Schmidt will have regular and direct access to the president for cyber security issues  the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the selection process.
 At the same time  cyber experts and potential job candidates have complained that the position lacks the budgetary and policy-making authority needed to be successful. Schmidt will report to the National Security Council and closely support the National Economic Council on cyber issues.
 Schmidt's selection suggests that economic and business interests in the White House held more sway in the selection process. Schmidt  president and CEO of the Information Security Forum  a nonprofit international consortium that conducts research in information security  has served as chief security officer for Microsoft and as cyber security chief for online auction giant eBay. He was reportedly preferred by Lawrence Summers  director of the economic council.

"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: In a very special course at Knnet School, the social-science teacher Adam Smith guides his students through the ""married life"". Unlike the traditional course, Adam makes his students experience the real problems married ones may face like housing and child care. ""No one tells kids about money-managing problems,"" says Adam. Each student should act out in ten weeks what normally takes couples ten years to finish. In the first week, one member of each couple is asked to get an after school job -- a real one. During the term, the income rules their life-style. In the third week, the couples must find an apartment they can afford. In the fifth week, the couples ""have a baby"" and then struggle to cover the costs of baby clothes and furniture. In week eight, the marriage comes to the breaking point by such disaster as a mother-in-law's moving in or death. It's all over by week ten (the tenth year of marriage). After serious discussion with lawyers about alimony   and child support, the students get divorced   . Adam's course, which has ""married"" 1,000 students since its beginning six years ago, is widely supported by parents and students. Some of the students have found the experience making them realize their real life marry plans are wrong. Marianne Baldrica, 16, who tried ""marriage"" last term with her boyfriend Eric Zook, 15, said, "" Eric and I used to get along pretty well before we took the course together. But I wanted to live in the city, he wanted the country. He wanted lots of kids, I wanted no kids. It's been four weeks since the course ended and Eric and I are just starting to talk to each other again.""

Title: The Adventures of Sparky the Magic Pencil

Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a magical pencil named Sparky. Sparky loved to draw and color, and whenever he did, his drawings would come to life! He lived in a small pencil case with his friends, erasers, and sharpeners.

One day, Sparky was feeling bored and wanted to go on an adventure. He looked around and saw a blank piece of paper on the desk. He thought, ""Why not draw myself a door and go explore the world?"" So, he picked up the pencil and drew a door.

As soon as he opened the door, he found himself in a colorful, magical world full of talking animals, flying dragons, and enchanted forests. Sparky was amazed and delighted, and he knew that he was going to have an amazing adventure.

Sparky met many new friends on his journey, including a wise owl, a friendly unicorn, and a mischievous monkey. They went on exciting quests together and solved puzzles to overcome challenges.

One day, Sparky and his friends came across a wicked witch who had captured a magical fairy. The fairy was in danger, and Sparky knew that he had to help her. He used his magic pencil to draw a sword and fought the witch. With the help of his friends, they were able to defeat the witch and rescue the fairy.

After their adventure, Sparky returned to his pencil case, happy and exhausted. He knew that he had made many new friends and had a lot of fun, but he was also grateful to be back home.

From that day on, Sparky continued to have many more adventures, always exploring new lands and meeting new friends. He realized that there was no limit to the adventures he could have, as long as he had his magic pencil and imagination.

One day, Sparky decided to go on a big adventure to find a lost city of gold. He gathered his friends, and they set out on a long journey. Along the way, they encountered many obstacles, including treacherous mountains and deep rivers. They also had to outsmart a group of sneaky pirates who tried to steal their map.

Finally, after many weeks of travel, they arrived at the lost city of gold. It was a beautiful place filled with treasure and wonders. Sparky and his friends explored every inch of the city and found many valuable items.

However, they soon realized that the city was guarded by a fierce dragon who would not let them leave with the treasure. Sparky knew that they had to defeat the dragon to escape safely. He used his magic pencil to draw a trap, and they were able to capture the dragon and make their escape.

After their adventure, Sparky and his friends returned to their home. They were tired but happy, knowing that they had accomplished something amazing.

Sparky continued to have many more adventures, each one more exciting than the last. He discovered hidden treasures, solved puzzles, and helped those in need. His magic pencil allowed him to explore the world in ways he never thought possible.

And so, Sparky lived happily ever after, always seeking out new adventures and using his magic pencil to bring his imagination to life.",ultrafeedback,good,963,False

"Based on the table below, which breed is not classified as a type of dog: Labrador, Siamese, Beagle, or Bulldog? The table contains information on breed height and weight.
Breed | Height (cm) | Weight (kg) 
--- | --- | ---
Labrador | 55-62 | 25-36 
Siamese | 30-35 | 4-6 
Beagle | 33-41 | 9-11 
Bulldog | 31-40 | 18-25 
To determine the breed that stands out as not a dog breed, I will use the following Go code:
package main
import (
	""fmt""
)
func main() {
	breeds := []string{""Labrador"", ""Siamese"", ""Beagle"", ""Bulldog""}
	for _, breed := range breeds {

		} else {
			fmt.Println(breed, ""is a dog breed."")
		}
	}

"In this task, you are given a passage which has a question and the context. You have to generate an answer to the question based on the information present in the context.

Example input: Context: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a heterogeneous disease with an uncertain pathogenesis. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease. A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score. 35 patients (40% female, age 48 ± 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease. In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (P = 0.03). ILC2s were also correlated with worsening nasal symptom score in CRS (P = 0.04).
Question: Are group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s ) increased in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or eosinophilia?
Example output: As ILC2s are elevated in patients with CRSwNP, they may drive nasal polyp formation in CRS. ILC2s are also linked with high tissue and blood eosinophilia and have a potential role in the activation and survival of eosinophils during the Th2 immune response. The association of innate lymphoid cells in CRS provides insights into its pathogenesis.
Example explanation: The output says that ILC2s are elevated in patients with CRSwNP and that they may drive nasal polyp formtion in CRS. The output also says that ILC2s are linked with blood eosinophilia and hence, it completely answers the question on the basis of the information in the context.
Q: Context: Impaired resolution of acute inflammation results in development of chronic inflammatory disorders such as atherosclerosis, asthma and arthritis. Clearance of apoptotic neutrophils by M2 macrophages, the process termed efferocytosis, is critical for complete resolution of inflammation as it prevents secondary necrosis caused by disgorgement of toxic contents from apoptotic cells in the inflamed site. In the present study, we investigated the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on efferocytosis.', 'To determine the effect of DHA on efferocytosis, murine macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells were co-incubated with apoptotic Jurkat T cells, and efferocytosis was assessed by flow cytometry. The expression and production of M1 and M2 markers were determined by RT-PCR, ELISA and flow cytometry. To demonstrate the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) in DHA-mediated effects, siRNA against PPARγ was utilized. The expression of PPARγ was examined by semiquantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. The PPARγ activation was measured by the electrophilic gel shift assay.', 'DHA enhanced the efferocytic ability of RAW264.7 cells, and induced their M2 polarization. Notably, knockdown of PPARγ abolished the stimulatory effect of DHA on M2 polarization as well as efferocytosis. Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was significantly inhibited by DHA, suggesting that DHA alters the macrophage phenotype in favor of M2 while it suppresses M1 polarization.\Question: Does docosahexaenoic acid induce M2 macrophage polarization through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ activation?
