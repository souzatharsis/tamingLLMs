% NAME THIS FILE: draft.sty (or name it draft.doc and run it through
% doc2sty) AND PUT IT IN YOUR MACROS OR TEXFORMATS DIRECTORY
%
% This is a first attempt at a draft option for the standard LaTeX styles.
% It still has several problems, which are detailed below.
% The draft option attempts to accomplish the following:
%  Without requiring any changes to a LaTeX file (other than specifying
%  the draft option :-) and without changing the formatting of the 
%  ``real'' text , mark the spots where \label, \cite, \ref, \index,
%  or \glossary commands occur in text, and print the command arguments
%  in the margin.
%
% USAGE:
% Specify draft as an optional argument to the documentstyle command
% e.g., \documentstyle[11pt,draft]{book}
%
% JUSTIFICATION:
% Why am I submitting this, even though it still has some problems?
%
%     1) Even in its present shape, I think it is fairly useful.
%        I was going crazy before, trying to remember labels, keys,
%        and so forth.  I am still going crazy, but now for different
%        reasons.
%     2) I'm just learning TeX, and don't expect to know enough to do this
%        correctly for a while.  Hopefully, someone who knows TeX will
%        agree this is a useful option, and will point out my mistakes.
%        Since the changes to the standard LateX routines are fairly minor,
%        and my mistakes are probably silly and quite obvious, this
%        may be easy to do.
%     3) I am interested in hearing ideas for other features for this
%        option.  This option includes some of the ideas of Dr. Rouben 
%        Rostamian (rostamia@umbc3.UMD.EDU) and I am interested in 
%        hearing from others.
%     4) Because of 2) and 3), I think we will end up with a better
%        draft option if I post this in its present form and ask for
%        help.

%
% FINALLY, THE DETAILS
%
% The option marks \label,\cite,\ref,\index, and \glossary commands in the
% text with a scriptsize calligraphic letter in the interline space 
% (L for label,
% C for cite, R for ref, I for index and G for glossary.
% The label, citation, is printed in the margin in scriptsize bold letters.  
%   
% For items which are input in horizontal mode, a \marginpar box holding 
% the text is put in the right margin (if there are no free boxes left, 
% the next option is used.) 
% 
% Items which are input in display math mode are shoved into the left
% margin (parboxes are not used, so it is possible for one label to 
% overwrite another, or for a label to run off the left edge of the page.)
% 
% Items which are input in non-display math mode and equation arrays
% are giving me problems.  The left margin code works fine for equations
% in the middle of text, but doesn't produce anything for equation arrays.
% Unfortunately, I haven't found a way to distinguish between the two
% cases.  For now, I simply raise the item and print it in small letters,
% and hope to avoid hitting any superscripts.
% 
% Right now, a space or extra bit of glue is getting inserted where the 
% item is, and thus the ``real'' text is not formatted quite the same in
% draft mode.  On the tests I've run so far, there hasn't been enough
% added space to actually change any of the linebreaks, so it doesn't
% seem to be a serious problem.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Okay, here it is %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% NOTE THIS:
% force all marginpar items into the right margin, to leave the left 
% margin for calls to marginalnote.

%
% MARGINALNOTE
%
% The following is a slightly rewritten version of Knuth's marginalstar stuff
% from the TeXBook, pg. 316.  It is used to put a marginalnote in the left
% margin.  The note is just shoved out and made right justified w.r.t. the
% left margin.  Two calls to marginalnote for the same line of text will
% be written one over the other.  Long marginal notes will extend off the
% page to the left.

% the spot where the item occurred.
%
\def\notemark#1{\rlap{%
\specialnote{\raise8pt\hbox{$\scriptscriptstyle\cal#1$}}}}
%
% Since I haven't found one approach that works in all modes, I
% have set up the makenote routine to use the following options
% (draftimm, draftdmm, draftinm, drafthm) in inner math mode,
% display math mode, inner non-math mode, and horizontal mode.
% If you don't like one, redefine it before the begin{document}
% line.
